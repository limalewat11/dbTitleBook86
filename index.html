Still, <i>Sports Illustrated</i>'s Alan Shipnuck struck gold by picking Beem and his rookie season as subjects to chronicle in <i>Bud, Sweat, &amp; Tees: A Walk on the Wild Side of the PGA Tour</i>. To begin with, he found a colorful player with a renegade personality who actually managed to confound the odds and post victory--at the 1999 Kemper Open. But there's more. As vivid a character as Beem turns out to be, his caddie Steve Duplantis, who'd previously toted for Jim Furyk, is a true rogue who makes Beem seem a choirboy by comparison.<p> Shipnuck provides all the necessary drama of life on the course, but the real fun of <i>Bud, Sweat, &amp; Tees</i> is life beyond it, how Beem and Duplantis survive the highs and lows the game provides. At his best, Shipnuck manages to bring together their shared existence within the ropes and beyond, nowhere better than in Memphis the week after Beem's victory. He and Duplantis, who first caddied for him at the Kemper, have gone to Tennessee to try qualifying for the 1999 U.S. Open. That Beem misses is but a sidelight of the tour de force sequence that sees their relationship form against the backdrop of Duplantis cheating on his ex-fiancï¿½e Shannon--recalled by both Duplantis and Shannon, who's nannying Duplantis's daughter--as Beem is trying to focus on his game.</p><p> It begins in a bar, the three of them together, with Beem ogling Shannon as she walks to the ladies' room, and Duplantis calling him on it. "The player-caddie dynamic is always delicate," writes Shipnuck, "to the point that it is often discussed in the nomenclature of a courtship. For Beem and Duplantis, then, winning their first tournament together was like sleeping together on a first date--fun, to be sure, but complicated. If they were going to have a meaningful long-term relationship they would need a few more nights like this, getting to know each other." The nights--and days--that follow are as fun to read as the greens at Augusta. --<i>Jeff Silverman</i></p><b>Alan Shipnuck</b> was a twenty-one-year-old intern when he wrote his first cover story for <i>Sports Illustrated.</i> Now a Senior Writer at <i>SI,</i> Shipnuck writes regularly on golf and has twice been a recipient of awards from the Golf Writers Association of America.

Meanwhile Arab culture was thriving, dazzling those Europeans fortunate enough to catch even a glimpse of the scientific advances coming from Baghdad, Antioch, or the cities of Persia, Central Asia, and Muslim Spain. T here, philosophers, mathematicians, and astronomers were steadily advancing the frontiers of knowledge and revitalizing the works of Plato and Aristotle. I n the royal library of Baghdad, known as the House of Wisdom, an army of scholars worked at the behest of the Abbasid caliphs. At a time when the best book collections in Europe held several dozen volumes, the House of Wisdom boasted as many as four hundred thousand. </p><p>Even while their countrymen waged bloody Crusades against Muslims, a handful of intrepid Christian scholars, thirsty for knowledge, traveled to Arab lands and returned with priceless jewels of science, medicine, and philosophy that laid the foundation for the Renaissance. I n this brilliant, evocative book, Lyons shows just how much "Western" culture owes to the glories of medieval Arab civilization, and reveals the untold story of how Europe drank from the well of Muslim learning.</p></p><p><p><b>Jonathan Lyons </b>served as an editor and foreign correspondent&#x2015;mostly in the Muslim world&#x2015;for Reuters for more than twenty years.

Most of us, however, know very little about the subject - and if Leon Morris is correct, much of what we think we know is wrong. In this brief introduction to apocalyptic, Morris brings together the results of a great deal of work that has been done on the subject by himself and others. In a clear and lucid style, he addresses himself to the characteristics of apocalyptic writings, the world from which they arose, and their relations to the gospel. &#34;Apocalyptic is not a good medium for expressing the cruciality of the cross,&#34; Morris concludes, :and in fact it does not express it... We cannot understand important sections of the New Testament without some knowledge of apocalyptic. But we cannot hold that apocalyptic contains the key to the whole...&#34;</p><p>NA</p><h2>A to Z Mysteries Boxed Set, Books A to H: The Absent Author, The Bald Bandit, The Canary Caper, The Deadly Dungeon, The Empty Envelope, The Falcon&#39;s Feathers, The Goose&#39;s Gold, and The Haunted Hotel</h2><p>This series features three smart kids who solve crimes and mysteries.

The Gospel of Jesus is that gospel. <p>Since its founding in 1985, the Jesus Seminar has been a pioneer in bringing historical Jesus scholarship to the general public, making vital but often complex studies accessible, understandable and relevant. In The Gospel of Jesus, Robert Funk and the Jesus Seminar take the work of popularizing historical Jesus studies in a new and exciting direction. This single composite gospel is created out of the stories told about and words ascribed to Jesus in the ancient gospels.</p></p><p>Composing a gospel like The Gospel of Jesus is nothing new. As the editor points out, creating a work like this is simply following the practices of the first evangelists: &#34;The authors of the ancient gospels freely plundered the work of their predecessors in composing their own texts...New compositions were written out by hand and often presented as solely the product of the new authors. The composers of the New Testament gospels created their gospels in the same way.&#34;Praise for The Gospel of Jesus: <p>"Bold and meticulous scholarship, with astonishing results. The Jesus that emerges from this gospel is at once more human and more mysterious than the Jesus of popular imagination. The singularity of this Jesus compels us to interpret anew what he said and did, quite as it compelled his first century followers."-JAMES CARSE, author of The Gospel of the Beloved Disciple </p><p>"This book will excite, challenge, intrigue and threaten readers. It is a worthy contribution to the fascinating Jesus debate that has captured our generation." -BISHOP JOHN S.

It is not in the nature of cyberspace to be unregulable; cyberspace has no nature.&#x201d; It only has code the software and hardware that make cyberspace what it is. That code can create a place of freedom as the original architecture of the Net did or a place of exquisitely oppressive control.If we miss this point, then we will miss how cyberspace is changing. Under the influence of commerce, cyberpsace is becoming a highly regulable space, where our behavior is much more tightly controlled than in real space.But that's not inevitable either. We can we must choose what kind of cyberspace we want and what freedoms we will guarantee. These choices are all about architecture: about what kind of code will govern cyberspace, and who will control it. In this realm, code is the most significant form of law, and it is up to lawyers, policymakers, and especially citizens to decide what values that code embodies.</p><p>Everyone knows that cyberspace is a wild frontier that can't be regulated, right? Everyone is wrong, and that's why we should all read Harvard Law prof (and famous Microsoft trial expert) Lawrence Lessig's eye-opening, jaw-dropping book <i>Code</i>, the best guide yet to the future that's heading our way like a frictionless freight train. For such an analytical book, it's also anecdote-studded and utterly fun to read.<p> Lessig leads us through the new controversies in intellectual property, privacy, free speech, and national sovereignty. What about a computer worm that can search every American's PC for top-secret NSA documents? It sounds obviously unconstitutional, but the worm code can't read your letters, bust down your door, scare you, or arrest anyone innocent. If you're not guilty, you won't even know you were searched. The coded architecture of the Net also enforces certain freedoms: via the Net, we have now globally exported a more extreme form of free speech than the First Amendment encodes in old-fashioned law. The once-important <i>Pentagon Papers</i> case would be meaningless today: instead of fighting to publish secret government documents, <i>The New York Times</i> could simply leak them to a USENET newsgroup. The Constitution is rife with ambiguities the framers couldn't have imagined, and virtual communities such as AOL and LamdaMOO are organizing themselves in ways governed largely by code--strikingly different ones.</p><p> We've got tough choices ahead. Do we want to protect intellectual property or privacy? How do we keep cyberporn from kids--by brain-dead decency laws, censoring filters, or code that identifies kid users? (Lessig advocates code.) Lessig demonstrates that legal structures are too slow and politics-averse to regulate cyberspace. "Courts are disabled, legislatures pathetic, and code untouchable." Code writers are the unacknowledged legislators of the new world, backed by the law and commerce. Lessig thinks citizens must recognize the need to be the architects of their own fate, or they'll find themselves coded into a world they never made. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>"[Lessig] has staked out a role as one of academia's avant-garde thinkers about cyberspace and the law."<br> The Wall Street Journal <p>"Lessig's exposition reads like a Stanley Kubrick film, with the menace made palpable by new technologies....It is a troubling book, and one that needs to be taken seriously."<br> Daniel Bell<br> author of The Coming of Post-Industrial Society </p><p>"Lessig penetrates the cyberfluff to reveal the deep structure of our brave new world."<br> Bruce Ackerman<br> Sterling Professor of Law and Political Science, Yale University </p><p>"This may be the most important book ever published about the Internet, as well as one of the most readable. Lessig's ideas are deep and insightful, and they will shape the way the future develops. He is a master at seeing the important ideas lurking behind things we all take for granted."<br> Mark A. Lemley<br> Boalt Hall School of Law, University of California, Berkeley </p><p>"Lawrence Lessig exposes the limits of prevailing views about how cyberspace is (and is not) regulated, and makes a compelling case for the urgency of learning to transcend those limits. Code is essential reading for those who care about the future of cyberspace, and of the human society within which "cyberspace" plays an increasingly central role."<br> Julie E. Cohen<br> Georgetown University Law Center </p><p>"Lawrence Lessig takes seriously the proposition that, in cyberspace, code is the law, and he traces out the consequences in a lucid and insightful way. If you want to know what daily life will be like in the computer-mediated twenty-first century, this is essential reading."<br> William J. Mitchell </p><p>"Lawrence Lessig is a James Madison of our time, crafting the lineaments of a well-tempered cyberspace. This book is a primer of "running code" for digital civilization. Like Madison, Lessig is a model of balance, judgement, ingenuity, and persuasive argument."<br> Stewart Brand<br> author of The Media Lab and The Clock of the Long Now </p><p>"Lessig's book is an astonishing achievement. The nation's leading scholar of cyberspace has produced a paradigm-shifting work that will transform the debate about the architecture of cyberspace. Lessig challenges us to make choices about freedom, privacy, intellectual property, and technology that most of us didn't recognize as choices in the first place. This dark, exhilarating work is the most important book of its generation about the relationship between law, cyberspace, and social organization."<br> Jeffrey Rosen<br> Legal Affairs Editor, The New Republic</p></p><h2>Golden Books Treasury of Elves and Fairies</h2><p>Offers a variety of stories in prose and in verse about the wee folk</p><p>Garth Williams was a prolific illustrator of Golden Books.

Encouraged by his parents who were voracious readers, Tom spent most of his childhood curled up reading everything he could get his hand on. This is Tom&#39;s first book for Scholastic.Fourteen-year-old Jonathan Sterling&#39;s secretive father lies in a hospital, mad and sick. This sets Jonathan, a truant student, on a mission to discover his father&#39;s hidden past. References to &#34;the darkness&#34; lead him to a library, where he meets Mary Anne, who has white skin, purple hair, and sedating perfume. She promises to lead him to Darkside, a hidden world beneath London. Colin Moody is chillingly convincing in this portrayal, and his narration becomes mysterious and forbidding as we follow Jonathan underground. Moody highlights Jonathan&#39;s desperation to understand, and then escape, the treacherous nineteenth-century world he finds there, which is peopled with vampires and ghouls. Particularly strong is Moody&#39;s growling depiction of a P.I. &#34;wereman&#34; who nearly eats Jonathan before becoming his friend.

(<i>The Observer</i>)</p><h2>Penguin Classics Down and Out in Paris and London (Penguin Modern Classics)</h2><p>George Orwell&#39;s vivid memoir of his time living among the desperately poor and destitute, Down and Out in Paris and London is a moving tour of the underworld of society. &#39;You have talked so often of going to the dogs - and well, here are the dogs, and you have reached them.&#39; Written when Orwell was a struggling writer in his twenties, it documents his &#39;first contact with poverty&#39;. Here, he painstakingly documents a world of unrelenting drudgery and squalor - sleeping in bug-infested hostels and doss houses of last resort, working as a dishwasher in Paris&#39;s vile &#39;Hï¿½tel X&#39;, surviving on scraps and cigarette butts, living alongside tramps, a star-gazing pavement artist and a starving Russian ex-army captain. Exposing a shocking, previously-hidden world to his readers, Orwell gave a human face to the statistics of poverty for the first time - and in doing so, found his voice as a writer.</p><p>What was a nice Eton boy like Eric Blair doing in scummy slums instead of being upwardly mobile at Oxford or Cambridge? Living <i>Down and Out in Paris and London</i>, repudiating respectable imperialist society, and reinventing himself as George Orwell. His 1933 debut book (ostensibly a novel, but overwhelmingly autobiographical) was rejected by that elitist publisher T.S. Eliot, perhaps because its close-up portrait of lowlife was too pungent for comfort. <p> In Paris, Orwell lived in verminous rooms and washed dishes at the overpriced "Hotel X," in a remarkably filthy, 110-degree kitchen. He met "eccentric people--people who have fallen into solitary, half-mad grooves of life and given up trying to be normal or decent." Though Orwell's tone is that of an outraged reformer, it's surprising how entertaining many of his adventures are: gnawing poverty only enlivens the imagination, and the wild characters he met often swindled each other and themselves. The wackiest tale involves a miser who ate cats, wore newspapers for underwear, invested 6,000 francs in cocaine, and hid it in a face-powder tin when the cops raided. They had to free him, because the apparently controlled substance turned out to be face powder instead of cocaine.</p><p> In London, Orwell studied begging with a crippled expert named Bozo, a great storyteller and philosopher. Orwell devotes a chapter to the fine points of London guttersnipe slang. Years later, he would put his lexical bent to work by inventing Newspeak, and draw on his down-and-out experience to evoke the plight of the Proles in <i>1984</i>. Though marred by hints of unexamined anti-Semitism, Orwell's debut remains, as <i>The Nation</i> put it, "the most lucid portrait of poverty in the English language." <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>7 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>To Live Is Christ to Die Is Gain</h2><p><b>Using Paul's radical letter to the Philippians as his road map, Matt Chandler forsakes the trendy to invite readers into authentic Christian maturity.</b>&nbsp;The short book of Philippians is one of the most quoted in the Bible, yet Paul wrote it not for the popular sound bites, but to paint a picture of a mature Christian faith. While many give their lives to Jesus, few then go on to live a life of truly vibrant faith.&nbsp;In this disruptively inspiring book, Chandler offers tangible ways to develop a faith of pursuing, chasing, knowing, and loving Jesus. Because if we clean up our lives but don't get Jesus, we've lost! So let the goal be Him. To live is Christ, to die is gain&#x2014;this is the message of the letter.

Propp (Anchor Bible)</h2><p><p>The long-awaited conclusion of William H. C. Propp&#x2019;s masterful study of Exodus, this informative, clearly written commentary provides a new perspective on Israelite culture and on the role of ritual, law, and covenant in biblical religion.<br><i>Exodus 19&#x2013;40 </i>sets a new standard in biblical scholarship. Thorough and up-to-date, it is the first commentary on Exodus to include critical textual evidence from the recently edited Dead Sea Scrolls. Informed by Propp&#x2019;s deep understanding of ancient cultural mores and religious traditions, it casts new light on the Israelites&#x2019; arrival at Sinai, their entry into a covenant with God, their reception of the Law, their worship of the golden calf, and their reconciliation to God. The incisive commentary on the building of the Holy Tabernacle&#x2013;God&#x2019;s wilderness abode&#x2013;is supplemented by numerous illustrations that clarify the biblical text. Propp extends the scope and relevance of this major work in five appendices that discuss the literary formation of the Torah, the historicity of the Exodus tradition, the origins of Israelite monotheism, the Exodus theme in the Bible, and the future of Old Testament scholarship. By taking an anthropological rather than strictly theological approach, Propp places familiar stories within a fresh context. The result is a fully accessible guide to one of the most important and best known books of the Bible.</p></p><p><p>is a professor of history and Judaic studies at the University of California, San Diego.

The Foreign Intelligence Service and the Federal Counterintelligence Service are the new shingles hanging outside the Lubyanka in Moscow, and journalist Albats, who earned a crusading reputation in a host of expos{&#x201a;}es about the previous tenant, the Committee for State Security, here piles up a mountainous indictment of the nominally defunct "Sword and Shield of the Revolution." Unfortunately for the casual reader, she details to a fault, and it's mainly those well versed in Soviet history who can digest her profiles (of a retired Chekist "investigator," that is, a torturer), feel her pain at documented cases of injustice (long excerpts provided), or evaluate her claim that secret police still infiltrate Russia's institutions, including the press. The fuel for her energetic anger, of course, is that no retribution has been, or is likely ever to be, visited on the executors of the Stalinist state, in contrast to certifiable Nazis, who notionally had to worry about being hauled before a court. Into that gap flow the ersatz tribunes of journalism, and however discursive this effort, its wrathfulness reveals what even average people had to confront in the KGB. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>Strange Harvests: The Hidden Histories of Seven Natural Objects</h2><p><b><b>"[</b><b><i>Strange Harvests </i></b><b>is] an impressive addition to the modern travelogue, painting some of the world's most remote terrain in visceral and sometimes breathtaking prose . . . an engrossing read." --NPR</b><br><br><b>An original and magical map of our world and its riches, formed of the stories of the small-scale harvests of seven natural objects</b></b><br><br>In this beguiling book, Edward Posnett journeys to some of the most far-flung locales on the planet to bring us seven wonders of the natural world--eiderdown, vicuï¿½a fiber, sea silk, vegetable ivory, civet coffee, guano, and edible birds' nests--that promise ways of using nature without damaging it. To the rest of the world these materials are mere commodities, but to their harvesters they are imbued with myth, tradition, folklore, and ritual, and form part of a shared identity and history.<br><i></i><br><i>Strange Harvests </i>follows the journeys of these uncommon products from some of the most remote areas of the world to its most populated urban centers, drawing on the voices of the people and little-known communities who harvest, process, and trade them. Blending history, travel writing, and interviews, Posnett sets these human stories against our changing economic and ecological landscape. What do they tell us about capitalism, global market forces, and overharvesting? How do local microeconomies survive in a hyperconnected world? Is it possible for us to live together with different species? <i>Strange Harvests</i> makes us see the world with wonder, curiosity, and new concern.</p><p>Edward Posnett was born in London. After a spell working in financial services, he started writing about nature, markets, and trade. His fascination with the Icelandic tradition of eiderdown harvesting led him to write&nbsp;&#x201c;Eiderdown,&#x201d;&nbsp;winner of the Bodley Head/Financial Times Essay Prize, and sparked this first book. He lives in Philadelphia.<p>Eiderdown</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In ï¿½safjï¿½rï¿½ur,&nbsp;the capital of Iceland's remote Westfjords region, a Lutheran pastor compared eiderdown to cocaine. "I sometimes think that we are like the coca farmers in Colombia," he said. "We [the down harvesters] get a fraction of the price when the product hits the streets of Tokyo. This is the finest down in the world and we are exporting it in black garbage bags."<br>It is difficult to describe the weight of eiderdown in a language in which the epitome of lightness is a feather. Unlike a feather's ordered barbs arranged around a solid shaft, under a microscope eiderdown offers a portrait of chaos: hundreds of soft threads branch out from a single point, twisting around one another. Upon each thread are countless small hooks, which allow the down to cling to itself, trapping pockets of air and warmth.<br>When I returned from Iceland, I asked my wife to close her eyes and put her hands out. After placing a duck-size clump of down in her hands, I asked her what she felt. "Heat," she said. She opened her eyes to find the down, a ghostly gray form, hovering above her palms, and pulled it apart, releasing the hooks. It crackled as if electrified, emitting a mild smell that reminded me of burned hair. She scrunched her hands, and the down disappeared in her fingers, compressed into a ball smaller than a duckling's bill.<br>Over centuries eiderdown has been treasured by those who shared their lands with the eider. The Vikings apparently filled their bedding with eiderdown, medieval tax collectors accepted it as a means of payment, and it's possible that the Romanov czars, whose dominions were home to some of the largest eider populations in the world, had a taste for the material. Today, its buyers are the global superrich. In Iceland I heard stories about Gulf royals who sleep under eiderdown in the desert, and Russian politicians whose hearts can be warmed with the gift of an eiderdown duvet.<br>The properties of eiderdown-extreme lightness and insulation-make sense when you consider the life of its owner. The eider is a fat seabird, more penguin than duck, and many of them spend most of their lives in the Arctic Circle. Visit the Icelandic coast and you will see hundreds, bobbing gregariously in the sea. Brash creatures, their boldness inspires admiration in the Icelanders. "The eider is an unsung hero, far braver than any bird of prey, which it is known to attack to protect its offspring," one local told me.<br>The story of how most feathers come to fill our bedding is anything but comforting. According to trade bodies, most feathers are a by-product of the meat industry. Less fortunate birds may have their plumage ripped out while they are still alive, a practice known as live-plucking (and reported to be common in China and Hungary, both major exporters of down).<br>As I held a clump of eiderdown in my hand, one Icelander told me something that seems to offer an alternative to this unsettling relationship between humans and birds. He said that the eider it once belonged to is probably still alive. Not in some dark barn, or even in an open-air enclosure, but in the wilds of the Arctic Circle.<br>In a cafï¿½ in ï¿½safjï¿½rï¿½ur,&nbsp;the pastor explained how he harvests eiderdown. As part of his parish duties, he runs a small farm, a throwback to earlier times when pastors in remote areas would survive off the land. Even now, life here can be unpredictable, especially in winter, when the weather turns violent. In 1995 two towns in the Westfjords were buried by avalanches, killing thirty-four people. Parish ministers were among the first to reach one of the villages and offer comfort to the survivors.<br>Every June, he said, about five hundred ducks arrive from the sea and waddle to his farm. Eiders do not naturally nest in such large colonies, but will congregate close to human settlements to seek shelter and protection. The ducks nest anywhere: in tires, doorways, and even houses. "I always take a lot of flags with me and I put a flag beside each nest so I will be able to find it again. Because they are incredibly camouflaged, these ducks. You can almost step on them."<br>At night the pastor guards the flock of eiders from their predators: seagulls, foxes, and mink. "I was quite lucky in that I got interested in guns when I was just a little over twenty," he said. "It was before I started studying theology." If he were to fall asleep, a fox would have a feast of sitting ducks. "It's more than a financial loss, it's also like they are depending on me. So I don't want to let them down. I used to be a night watchman so I have a little bit of experience staying awake."<br>In the Middle Ages, pelicans were thought to pierce their own breast to draw blood to feed their young. The mythical act was known as <i>vulning</i>, a Christlike act of self-sacrifice.<br>On the pastor's land the eider, too, makes herself vulnerable for her offspring, though it is down, not blood, that she draws from her breast. From this down she builds a nest for her eggs; her own bare skin, freshly revealed, covers them with warmth. She sits on her eggs for some twenty-eight days, during which she may lose a third of her body weight; some mothers may starve to death.<br>After incubation, the eggs hatch, the mothers waddle back to the sea with their offspring, and the pastor gathers their down, his protection fee. "I never collect the down until they are gone," he said. "Some of the farmers say they like to take a little bit of the down [while the ducks are still nesting]. I just like to leave them, not to disturb them in any way. . . . If you frighten them, they jump up and shit all over the nest." The "shit" he describes is not in fact excrement, but a brown oily liquid with an odor similar to that of frying liver. "[It is] so strong," recorded one Belgian eider enthusiast, "that an egg touched with it is refused and even discarded by the hungriest dog."<br>The scene described by the pastor has been a common sight in Iceland for centuries. Down has been collected here probably since the arrival of Norse settlers in the ninth century. The sight of thousands of tame eiders close to human settlements astounded early European travelers in Iceland. C. W. Shepherd, an Englishman who visited the island of Vigur in the Westfjords in 1862, described a farm besieged by eiders: "The earthen walls that surrounded it, and the window embrasures, were occupied by ducks. On the ground, the house was fringed with ducks. On the turf slopes of the roof, we could see ducks; and a duck sat in the scraper. . . . A windmill was infested; and so were all the outhouses, mounds, rocks, and crevices. The ducks were everywhere."<br>Environmentalists, economists, and ornithologists have all fallen in love with Icelandic harvesting. There is an irresistible simplicity to the relationship between the harvesters and the eiders. If a harvester cares for the ducks, more and more will come to nest, increasing the amount of down that can be gathered. At times, the relationship can be tested. As the pastor told me, some harvesters cannot resist collecting the down while it is still fresh, removing a portion of an eider's nest before her eggs have hatched and replacing it with straw. It is not pleasant to watch nesting eiders being disturbed, but they quickly return to their nests and apparently do not hold grudges; the same ducks return year after year.<br>In 1914, Charles Wendell Townsend, a physician and amateur ornithologist from Massachusetts, became obsessed by the Icelandic method while investigating the declining numbers of eiders in Labrador, Newfoundland, and Nova Scotia. Dismayed by the practice of duck hunting in North America, he proposed the introduction of eider reservations where down could be harvested for profit. He had read about Icelandic harvesting in travelers' accounts and dreamed of introducing a utopia of ecology and commerce along the coast of the United States and Canada. "The cooing notes, so long few or absent in many places, would again resound over the waters," Townsend wrote in "A Plea for the Conservation of the Eider" (1914). "And best of all, to the practical minded, the birds would pay well for their protection by gifts of eggs and of valuable eider-down."<br>I wondered how fragile the relationship is between Icelanders and the ducks, and whether the drive for profit might somehow kill the golden goose. If demand for down reaches the level of that for rhino horn, bear gallbladders, or elephant ivory, could the eider be driven to extinction? Might Icelanders have to develop intensive farming techniques to increase the supply of down, possibly to reduce illegal hunting?<br>These possibilities seem remote in Iceland, where eiders have been respected for centuries. I saw this firsthand on the remote island of Vigur, which looks out into the Arctic Circle. I met a sixteen-year-old boy whose family has inhabited a farm on the island since the nineteenth century. On his forearms I noticed dozens of small scars from wounds inflicted by puffins, which he catches, midflight, with a vast butterfly net. He was happy to snap hundreds of puffins' necks to kill them for their meat, but the eider was untouchable, a sacred bird. His uncle later explained that eiderdown accounts for more than a third of the family's income.<br>If the Icelanders' relationship with the ducks does change, then it may be for different reasons. The Norwegians once harvested down all along their coastline, but in the 1960s they discovered a far more profitable natural resource-oil-and began to move away from remote coastal areas. "The eiders tried to move with them because they felt protected by humans," explained one harvester. "The ducks would rather live with cats and dogs than seagulls."<br>Iceland has not yet struck oil, but it does have untapped reserves of hydroelectric and geothermal power, which the government is looking to exploit and export. (It is considering plans to lay a submarine cable between Iceland and Scotland that would provide electricity for European homes.)<br>The future of Iceland's renewable energy sources rouses strong feelings in the country, where large swaths of pristine landscape have already been flooded, or "drowned," to create the conditions required for hydroelectric power generation. If the Icelanders choose to develop their country's renewable energy sources to the full and export electricity as the Norwegians export oil, eiderdown harvesting may begin to seem an outdated tradition.<br>In the cycle of a natural resource, it is generally its extraction that is its most unpleasant and destructive stage. To win rights to an oil block in a developing country, an oil company may slip a sweetener into an official's pocket. To increase the production of feathers, a goose farmer may find it profitable to wrench them from a bird while it is still alive. The story of down harvesting is so different from these narratives of compromise and degradation. Once down is traded and marketed, however, it becomes just like any other commodity.<br>"What looks like a nice, peaceful, old-fashioned small trade from the outside is actually an octopus of monopoly and manipulations," said&nbsp;Jï¿½n Sveinsson, an Icelandic businessman. "Scratch the surface, follow the money, and the picture quickly changes from idyllic hobby to cutthroat exploitation."<br>A former naval officer, Sveinsson has devoted his life to eiderdown. Unlike many harvesters, he is involved in all stages of its life cycle, from the duck's nest to an oligarch's bedding. Since childhood, he has harvested down on his family's farm in the Westfjords, later investing hundreds of thousands of euros developing his own machinery to dry and clean it. Above all, he is a marketing man. An avid reader of Edgar Allan Poe, he compared his marketing efforts to detective work, "looking for traces of potential clients, finding what spots they frequent, like a hunter tracks a rare game to its watering hole."<br>Sveinsson explained that to produce a single kilo of refined down takes a colossal amount of work. About sixty nests must be collected, dried, and cleaned to remove dirt, seaweed, and vegetation. This process was mechanized in the 1950s when Icelanders developed their own drying and cleaning technology. Despite all this labor, the value of the down produced and refined in Iceland is only a fraction of its retail price. Intermediaries, such as Japanese and European wholesalers, buy in bulk after it has been processed. It is then stuffed into pillows, duvets, and clothing sold in Japan, China, Germany, and Russia. The Icelanders receive about $3.4 million for the three metric tons of down that-give or take-they export each year, but according to Sveinsson, its retail value may be ten times this amount. "The harvesters actually get a lower percentage of the retail value than an African coffee grower," he says.<br>His words reminded me of what the writer Rebecca Solnit called (in a 2008 essay for <i>Harper's Magazine</i>) Iceland's "fairy tale told backward," in which its people "had been dispossessed of their great gifts and birthrights." It began, she argues, about three decades ago, when Iceland privatized the right to fish and introduced quotas that could be traded and accumulated. Today large firms predominantly control the fishing industry. Then in 2006 a remote highland wilderness in eastern Iceland was flooded to create a huge reservoir as a power source for an aluminum smelter. The cost of the hydropower project was about $2 billion, much of it borrowed from international banks. Critics of the plan claim that the environmental and financial price was too high for the several hundred jobs it created.<br>Eiderdown, sold off cheaply, seemed to be just another chapter in this story. The writer Andri&nbsp;Snï¿½r Magnason points out that the Icelandic word for "windfall" is <i>hvalreki</i>, literally a beached whale. While a windfall in English evokes falling fruit, its Icelandic translation is a stranded sea mammal, a gift of free meat.<br>When explaining why the Icelanders are getting such a raw deal from down, Sveinsson pointed to Iceland's historical relationship with its largest export, fish. "Abundant fishing grounds have been a resource that have shaped the Icelandic economy as well as our mentality, a blessing and a curse in one," he said. "A kind of hand-to-mouth attitude developed-there was always the knowledge that one day the weather would calm down and the boat could set off for another good catch."<br>In myths, fables, and hagiographies, one often reads of the ability of individuals to tame wild creatures, burnishing their reputation for virtue, sensitivity, or holiness. It is said that Saint Cuthbert, the seventh-century missionary who settled on the Farne Islands off the Northumbrian coast, protected and tamed eiders. (Today in Northumberland the eider is sometimes called Saint Cuthbert's or Cuddy duck). Many of these stories were built upon embellishment or pure fantasy, but in Iceland, travelers' accounts repeatedly confirmed the existence of this strange relationship between Icelanders and the ducks. Writing in 1875, the English explorer Richard Burton commented that the eider was a "barn door" bird as "tame as horse-pond geese." "No salute must be fired at Reykjavik," he wrote, "for fear of frightening 'somateria mollissima.'"</p></p><h2>Physical Science Lab Man Te</h2><p>Arranged similarly to the student Textbook TE, the Physical Science Teacher&#x2019;s Edition Lab Manual, 5th ed., provides all the necessary information for completing each lab activity successfully.

He is unique in being an American poet comfortable in three languages, and his work is filled with a dynamic language play, cross-linguistic puns, and themes of speculation on language, translation, and nomadism.

He'd just spent the warm summer day in the saddle rounding up cattle. All he wanted to do was kick off his boots and hit the hay early. The last thing he wanted was company.<p>But whoever was knocking didn't sound as if they were planning to go away anytime soon. Living at the end of a dirt road, he didn't get uninvited company&#x2014;other than one of his five brothers. <i>So that narrows it down,</i> he thought as he went to the window and peered out through the curtains.</p><p>The car parked outside was a compact, lime-green with Montana State University plates. Definitely not one of his brothers, he thought with a grin. Chisholm men wouldn't be caught dead driving such a "girlie" car. Especially a lime-green one.</p><p>Even more odd was the young, willowy blonde pounding on his door. She must be lost and needing directions. Or she was selling something.</p><p>His curiosity piqued, he went to answer her persistent knock. As the door swung open, he saw that her eyes were blue and set wide in a classically gorgeous face. She wore a slinky red dress that fell over her body like water. The woman was a stunner. She smiled warmly. "Hi."</p><p>"Hi." He waited, wondering what she wanted, and enjoying the view in the meantime.</p><p>Her smile slipped a little as she took in his worn jeans, his even more worn cowboy boots and the dirty Western shirt with a torn sleeve and a missing button.</p><p>"I wasn't expecting company," he said when he saw her apparent disappointment in his attire.</p><p>"Oh?" She looked confused now. "Did I get the night wrong? You're Zane Chisholm and this is Friday, right?"</p><p>"Right." He frowned. "Did we have a date or something?" He knew he'd never seen this woman before. No red-blooded American male would forget a woman like this.</p><p>She reached into her sparkly shoulder bag and pulled out a folded sheet of paper. "Your last email," she said, handing it to him.</p><p>He took the paper, unfolded it and saw his email address. It appeared he had been corresponding with this woman for the past two days.</p><p>"If you forgot&#x2014;"</p><p>"No," he said quickly. "Please, come in and let's see if we can sort this out."</p><p>She stepped in but looked tentative, as if not so sure about him.</p><p>"Why don't you start with how we met," he said as he offered her a seat.</p><p>She sat on the edge of the couch. "The Evans rural internet dating service."</p><p>"Arlene's matchmaking business?" he asked in surprise. Arlene Evans, who was now Arlene Monroe, had started the business a few years ago to bring rural couples together.</p><p>"We've been visiting by email until you..."</p><p>"Asked you out," he finished for her.</p><p>"Are you saying someone else has been using your email?"</p><p>"It sure looks that way, since I never signed up with Arlene's matchmaking service. But," he added quickly when he saw how upset she was, "I wouldn't be surprised if Arlene is behind this. It wouldn't be the first time she took it upon herself to play matchmaker." Either that or his brothers were behind it as a joke, though that seemed unlikely. This beautiful woman was no joke.</p><p>She looked down at her hands in her lap. "I'm so embarrassed." She quickly rose to her feet. "I should go."</p><p>"No, wait," he said, unable to shake the feeling that maybe this had been fate and that he would be making the biggest mistake of his life if he let this woman walk out now.</p><p>"You know, it wouldn't take me long to jump in the shower and change if you're still up for a date," he said with a grin.</p><p>She hesitated. "Really? I mean, you don't have to&#x2014;"</p><p>"I <i>want</i> to. But you have the advantage over me. I don't know your name."</p><p>She smiled shyly. "Courtney Baxter." She held out her hand. As he shook it, Zane thought, <i>This night could change my life.</i></p><p>He had no idea how true that was going to be.</p></p><h2>House of Mist And, the Shrouded Woman: Novels by Maria Luisa Bombal (Texas Pan American Series)</h2><p>&#34;Bombal--with her bold disregard for simple realism in favor of a heightened reality in which the external world reflects the internal truth of the characters&#39; feeling, and with her deliberate mingling of fantasy, memory and event--is the precursor of the magical realism that is the flower of South American writing today. . . .

[Her] themes of erotic frustration, social marginality, and cosmic transcendence must be considered as a profound expression of women&#39;s predicament presented through a feminine perspective.&#34; --Women Writers of Spanish America The shrouded woman, a corpse reviewing her life as she views the mourners at her wake, perceives in the personal ties that made up her life a failure of all parties to benefit from the possibilities of true intimacy. Helga, the heroine of House of Mist, has a powerfully imaginative inner life entirely unappreciated by her husband until he finally learns to value her as something more than a trophy. In these two evocative novels, a daring blend of magical elements, innovative style, and unsparing social criticism opens a window on the privileged yet artificially useless lives of upper-class Chilean women of the earlier twentieth century. House of Mist was first published in 1935 as La ï¿½ltima niebla and translated into English by the author in 1947. The Shrouded Woman (La amortajada) was published in Spanish in 1938 and in English in 1948, again in the author&#39;s own translation.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Spanish</p><h2>The Science of Discworld II: The Globe</h2><p>The acclaimed Science of Discworld centred around an original Pratchett story about the Wizards of Discworld.

The second she walked into the kitchen she felt the hostility, like the bone-deep cold of the wind that blew through the streets of Berlin before a February snowstorm. She almost turned and walked back out again.<br><br>It was unusual for them to fight. Mostly they were affectionate&#x2014;too much so. Carla cringed when they kissed in front of other people. Her friends thought it was strange: their parents did not do that. She had said that to her mother, once. Mother had laughed in a pleased way and said: &#x201c;The day after our wedding, your father and I were separated by the Great War.&#x201d; She had been born English, though you could hardly tell. &#x201c;I stayed in London while he came home to Germany and joined the army.&#x201d; Carla had heard this story many times, but Mother never tired of telling it. &#x201c;We thought the war would last three months, but I didn&#x2019;t see him again for five years. All that time I longed to touch him. Now I never tire of it.&#x201d;<br><br>Father was just as bad. &#x201c;Your mother is the cleverest woman I ever met,&#x201d; he had said here in the kitchen just a few days ago. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I married her. It had nothing to do with . . .&#x201d; He had trailed off, and Mother and he had giggled conspiratorially, as if Carla at the age of eleven knew nothing about sex. It was so embarrassing.<br><br>But once in a while they had a quarrel. Carla knew the signs. And a new one was about to erupt.<br><br>They were sitting at opposite ends of the kitchen table. Father was somberly dressed in a dark gray suit, starched white shirt, and black satin tie. He looked dapper, as always, even though his hair was receding and his waistcoat bulged a little beneath the gold watch chain. His face was frozen in an expression of false calm. Carla knew that look. He wore it when one of the family had done something that angered him.<br><br>He held in his hand a copy of the weekly magazine for which Mother worked, The Democrat. She wrote a column of political and diplomatic gossip under the name of Lady Maud. Father began to read aloud. &#x201c;&#x2018; &#x2018;Our new chancellor, Herr Adolf Hitler, made his debut in diplomatic society at President Hindenburg&#x2019;s reception.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>The president was the head of state, Carla knew. He was elected, but he stood above the squabbles of day-to-day politics, acting as referee. The chancellor was the premier. Although Hitler had been made chancellor, his Nazi Party did not have an overall majority in the Reichstag&#x2014;the German parliament&#x2014;so, for the present, the other parties could restrain Nazi excesses.<br><br>Father spoke with distaste, as if forced to mention something repellent, like sewage. &#x201c; &#x2018;He looked uncomfortable in a formal tailcoat.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Carla&#x2019;s mother sipped her coffee and looked out of the window to the street, as if interested in the people hurrying to work in scarves and gloves. She, too, was pretending to be calm, but Carla knew she was just waiting for her moment.<br><br>The maid, Ada, was standing at the counter in an apron, slicing cheese. She put a plate in front of Father, but he ignored it. &#x201c; &#x2018;Herr Hitler was evidently charmed by Elisabeth Cerruti, the cultured wife of the Italian ambassador, in a rose-pink velvet gown trimmed with sable.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Mother always wrote about what people were wearing. She said it helped the reader picture them. She herself had fine clothes, but times were hard and she had not bought anything new for years. This morning she looked slim and elegant in a navy blue cashmere dress that was probably as old as Carla.<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2018;Signora Cerruti, who is Jewish, is a passionate Fascist, and they talked for many minutes. Did she beg Hitler to stop whipping up hatred of Jews?&#x2019;&#x201d; Father put the magazine down on the table with a slap.<br><br>Here it comes, Carla thought.<br><br>&#x201c;You realize that will infuriate the Nazis,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;I hope so,&#x201d; Mother said coolly. &#x201c;The day they&#x2019;re pleased with what I write, I shall give it up.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re dangerous when riled.&#x201d;<br><br>Mother&#x2019;s eyes flashed anger. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you dare condescend to me, Walter. I know they&#x2019;re dangerous&#x2014;that&#x2019;s why I oppose them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t see the point of making them irate.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You attack them in the Reichstag.&#x201d; Father was an elected parliamentary representative for the Social Democratic Party.<br><br>&#x201c;I take part in a reasoned debate.&#x201d;<br><br>This is typical, Carla thought. Father was logical, cautious, law-abiding. Mother had style and humor. He got his way by quiet persistence, she with charm and cheek. They would never agree.<br><br>Father added: &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t drive the Nazis mad with fury.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps that&#x2019;s because you don&#x2019;t do them much harm.&#x201d;<br><br>Father was irritated by her quick wit. His voice became louder. &#x201c;And you think you damage them with jokes?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I mock them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And that&#x2019;s your substitute for argument.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I believe we need both.&#x201d;<br><br>Father became angrier. &#x201c;But, Maud, don&#x2019;t you see how you&#x2019;re putting yourself and your family at risk?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;On the contrary. The real danger is not to mock the Nazis. What would life be like for our children if Germany became a Fascist state?&#x201d;<br><br>This kind of talk made Carla feel queasy. She could not bear to hear that the family was in danger. Life must go on as it always had. She wished she could sit in this kitchen for an eternity of mornings, with her parents at opposite ends of the pine table, Ada at the counter, and her brother, Erik, thumping around upstairs, late again. Why should anything change?<br><br>She had listened to political talk every breakfast-time of her life and she thought she understood what her parents did, and how they planned to make Germany a better place for everyone. But lately they had begun to talk in a different way. They seemed to think that a terrible danger loomed, but Carla could not quite imagine what it was.<br><br>Father said: &#x201c;God knows I&#x2019;m doing everything I can to hold back Hitler and his mob.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And so am I. But, when you do it, you believe you&#x2019;re following a sensible course.&#x201d; Mother&#x2019;s face hardened in resentment. &#x201c;And when I do it I&#x2019;m accused of putting the family at risk.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And with good reason,&#x201d; said Father. The row was only just getting started, but at that moment Erik came down, clattering like a horse on the stairs, and lurched into the kitchen with his school satchel swinging from his shoulder. He was thirteen, two years older than Carla, and there were unsightly black hairs sprouting from his upper lip. When they were small, Carla and Erik had played together all the time; but those days were over, and since he had grown so tall he had pretended to think she was stupid and childish. In fact she was smarter than he, and knew about a lot of things he did not understand, such as women&#x2019;s monthly cycles.<br><br>&#x201c;What was that last tune you were playing?&#x201d; he said to Mother.<br><br>The piano often woke them in the morning. It was a Steinway grand&#x2014;inherited, like the house itself, from Father&#x2019;s parents. Mother played in the morning because, she said, she was too busy the rest of the day and too tired in the evening. This morning she had performed a Mozart sonata, then a jazz tune. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s called &#x2018;Tiger Rag,&#x2019;&#x201d; she told Erik. &#x201c;Do you want some cheese?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jazz is decadent,&#x201d; Erik said.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be silly.&#x201d;<br><br>Ada handed Erik a plate of cheese and sliced sausage, and he began to shovel it in. Carla thought his manners were dreadful.<br><br>Father looked severe. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s been teaching you this nonsense, Erik?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hermann Braun says that jazz isn&#x2019;t music, just Negroes making a noise.&#x201d; Hermann was Erik&#x2019;s best friend; his father was a member of the Nazi Party.<br><br>&#x201c;Hermann should try to play it.&#x201d; Father looked at Mother, and his face softened. She smiled at him. He went on: &#x201c;Your mother tried to teach me ragtime, many years ago, but I couldn&#x2019;t master the rhythm.&#x201d;<br><br>Mother laughed. &#x201c;It was like trying to get a giraffe to roller-skate.&#x201d;<br><br>The fight was over, Carla saw with relief. She began to feel better. She took some black bread and dipped it in milk.<br><br>But now Erik wanted an argument. &#x201c;Negroes are an inferior race,&#x201d; he said defiantly.<br><br>&#x201c;I doubt that,&#x201d; Father said patiently. &#x201c;If a Negro boy were brought up in a nice house full of books and paintings, and sent to an expensive school with good teachers, he might turn out to be smarter than you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s ridiculous!&#x201d; Erik protested.<br><br>Mother put in: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t call your father ridiculous, you foolish boy.&#x201d; Her tone was mild: she had used up her anger on Father. Now she just sounded wearily disappointed. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re talking about, and neither does Hermann Braun.&#x201d;<br><br>Erik said: &#x201c;But the Aryan race must be superior&#x2014;we rule the world!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your Nazi friends don&#x2019;t know any history,&#x201d; Father said. &#x201c;The Ancient Egyptians built the pyramids when Germans were living in caves. Arabs ruled the world in the Middle Ages&#x2014;the Muslims were doing algebra when German princes could not write their own names. It&#x2019;s nothing to do with race.&#x201d;<br><br>Carla frowned and said: &#x201c;What is it to do with, then?&#x201d;<br><br>Father looked at her fondly. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a very good question, and you&#x2019;re a bright girl to ask it.&#x201d; She glowed with pleasure at his praise. &#x201c;Civilizations rise and fall&#x2014;the Chinese, the Aztecs, the Romans&#x2014;but no one really knows why.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Eat up, everyone, and put your coats on,&#x201d; Mother said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s getting late.&#x201d;<br><br>Father pulled his watch out of his waistcoat pocket and looked at it with raised eyebrows. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not late.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to take Carla to the Francks&#x2019; house,&#x201d; Mother said. &#x201c;The girls&#x2019; school is closed for a day&#x2014;something about repairing the furnace&#x2014;so Carla&#x2019;s going to spend today with Frieda.&#x201d;<br><br>Frieda Franck was Carla&#x2019;s best friend. Their mothers were best friends, too. In fact, when they were young, Frieda&#x2019;s mother, Monika, had been in love with Father&#x2014;a hilarious fact that Frieda&#x2019;s grandmother had revealed one day after drinking too much Sekt.<br><br>Father said: &#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t Ada look after Carla?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ada has an appointment with the doctor.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah.&#x201d;<br><br>Carla expected Father to ask what was wrong with Ada, but he nodded as if he already knew, and put his watch away. Carla wanted to ask, but something told her she should not. She made a mental note to ask Mother later. Then she immediately forgot about it.<br><br>Father left first, wearing a long black overcoat. Then Erik put on his cap&#x2014;perching it as far back on his head as it would go without falling off, as was the fashion among his friends&#x2014;and followed Father out of the door.<br><br>Carla and her mother helped Ada clear the table. Carla loved Ada almost as much as she loved her mother. When Carla was little, Ada had taken care of her full-time, until she was old enough to go to school, for Mother had always worked. Ada was not married yet. She was twenty-nine and homely-looking, though she had a lovely kind smile. Last summer she had had a romance with a policeman, Paul Huber, but it had not lasted.<br><br>Carla and her mother stood in front of the mirror in the hall and put on their hats. Mother took her time. She chose a dark blue felt, with a round crown and a narrow brim, the type all the women were wearing, but she tilted hers at a different angle, making it look chic. As Carla put on her knitted wool cap, she wondered whether she would ever have Mother&#x2019;s sense of style. Mother looked like a goddess of war, her long neck and chin and cheekbones carved out of white marble; beautiful, yes, but definitely not pretty. Carla had the same dark hair and green eyes, but looked more like a plump doll than a statue. Carla had once accidentally overheard her grandmother say to Mother: &#x201c;Your ugly duckling will grow into a swan, you&#x2019;ll see.&#x201d; Carla was still waiting for it to happen.<br><br>When Mother was ready, they went out. Their home stood in a row of tall, gracious town houses in the Mitte district, the old center of the city, built for high-ranking ministers and army officers such as Carla&#x2019;s grandfather, who had worked at the nearby government buildings.<br><br>Carla and her mother rode a tram along Unter den Linden, then took the S train from Friedrich Strasse to the Zoo Station. The Francks lived in the southwestern suburb of Schï¿½neberg.<br><br>Carla was hoping to see Frieda&#x2019;s brother Werner, who was fourteen. She liked him. Sometimes Carla and Frieda imagined they each married the other&#x2019;s brother, and were next-door neighbors, and their children were best friends. It was just a game to Frieda, but Carla was secretly serious. Werner was handsome and grown-up and not a bit silly like Erik. In the dollhouse in Carla&#x2019;s bedroom, the mother and father sleeping side by side in the miniature double bed were called Carla and Werner, but no one knew that, not even Frieda.<br><br>Frieda had another brother, Axel, seven, but he had been born with spina bifida, and had to have constant medical care.

The Francks were rich: Frieda&#x2019;s father, Ludwig, owned a factory making radio sets. Two cars stood in the driveway. The large shiny black one belonged to Herr Franck. The engine rumbled, and a cloud of blue vapor rose from the tailpipe. The chauffeur, Ritter, with uniform trousers tucked into high boots, stood cap in hand ready to open the door. He bowed and said: &#x201c;Good morning, Frau von Ulrich.&#x201d;<br><br>The second car was a little green two-seater.

These writings told a story of Christianity that was by turns unique and disturbing, hopeful and uplifting. The best way to describe them is collectively, with a term they themselves use: The Jesus Sutras.<br><br>The origins of Christianity seem rooted in Western civilization, but amazingly, an ancient, largely unknown branch of Christian belief evolved in the East. Eminent theologian and Chinese scholar Martin Palmer provides the first popular history and translation of the sect's long-lost scriptures--all of them more than a thousand years old and comparable in significance to the Dead Sea Scrolls. Gathered, deciphered, and interpreted by a team of expert linguists and scholars, these sacred texts present an inspiring use of Jesus' teachings and life within Eastern practices and meditations--and provide an extraordinary window into an intriguing, profoundly gentler, more spiritual Christianity than existed in Europe or Asia at the time, or, indeed, even today.<br><br>Palmer has devoted more than a decade to seeking the extant writings and other evidence of this lost religion.&nbsp;&nbsp;His search was triggered by an encounter with an immense, mysterious carved (stele) stone from the 8th century that resides in a Chinese museum collection called the Forest of Stones. The Chinese text on this stone commemorates the founding of a "religion of light" in China by a great Western teacher and features a unique cross that merges Taoist symbolism with the Christian cross. The scrolls, the stone, and a strange map of the area around a hallowed temple (where Lao Tzu wrote the Tao Te Ching before disappearing forever) gave Palmer enough information to rediscover one of the earliest Christian monasteries.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the site was an&nbsp;&nbsp;8th century pagoda still intact, and within it, in 1998, Palmer and his team found more evidence, including statues, underground passageways, and artifacts, that helped them uncover and recreate the era and rituals of the Taoist Christians.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The Taoist Christians, who wrote the Jesus Sutras recognized equality of the sexes, preached against slavery, and practiced nonviolence toward all forms of life. In particular, this tradition offered its followers a more hopeful vision of life on earth and after death than the dominant Eastern religions, teaching that Jesus had broken the wheel of karma and its consequent punishing, endless reincarnations.<br><br>Vividly re-creating the turbulence of a distant age that is remarkably evocative of our own times, Palmer reveals an extraordinary evolution of spiritual thought that spans centuries. A thrilling modern quest that is also an ancient religious odyssey, The Jesus Sutras shares a revolutionary discovery with profound historical implications--imparting timeless messages and lessons for men and women of all backgrounds and faiths.</p><p>It's no secret that there were Christians in China as far back as the seventh century. But exactly what they believed has been difficult to discern. In his book <i>The Jesus Sutras</i>, translator and interfaith pioneer Martin Palmer begins to shed light on what he has come to call Taoist Christianity, referring to ancient texts found only a century ago and drawing on his own sleuthing in China. In a book of ambitious scope, Palmer recounts Christianity's spread eastward from Jerusalem, where it encountered and adapted to local cultures. One of those cultures was the most powerful and advanced civilization in the world--Tang China--but which was also steeped in a retro-shamanic faith known as Taoism. Just as the Chinese assimilated Buddhism by interpreting it in Taoist terms, a similarly fascinating fusion of beliefs appears to have taken place in China's Christian monasteries. Palmer takes us to the site of one of these sanctuaries, which was once the Taoist equivalent of Canterbury Cathedral and which the Chinese government is now excavating and restoring in earnest. He also offers full English translations of what he calls the Jesus Sutras, Christian tracts translated into Chinese from an unknown Eastern language. While bearing clear resemblance to traditional Christianity, differences, and what one may call advances, are also apparent--for instance, original sin becomes the goodness of original nature. <i>The Jesus Sutras</i> is a powerful combination of research, translation, and interpretation that not only brings the past to light but lights the way for future interfaith dialogue. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>"<i>The Jesus Sutras</i> tells a valuable history of the beautiful teachings of a faith built on living practices of brotherhood and peace. The Sutras show us the interbeing nature of Jesus, Buddha, Tao, peoples, cultures, transformation, salvation and unity through deep and mindful living."<br>--THICH NHAT HANH<br> Author of <i>Living Buddha, Living Christ</i><br><br>"<i>The Jesus Sutras</i> is a spellbinding story of the rediscovery of the earliest traces of Christianity in China and an imaginative reconstruction of the subsequent development of this alien faith from the Far West in the Middle Kingdom. Martin Palmer's infectious enthusiasm for his subject is evident throughout and enables him to illuminate numerous facets of the Religion of Light that were hitherto unknown to modern scholars. The result is not only the moving account of the author's personal quest to comprehend a phenomenally important but strangely mysterious stele inscription, it is also one of the most fascinating chapters ever written in the history of world religions."<br>--VICTOR H. MAIR<br> Professor of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies<br> University of Pennsylvania<br> Translator of <i>Tao Te Ching</i> and <i>Wandering on the Way</i><br><br>"In offering a tantalizing glimpse of a distant past when Christian, Taoist, and Buddhist ideas achieved a brilliant fusion in China, <i>The Jesus Sutras</i> inspire hope for a future in which celebration of diversity may one day triumph over the sterile certainties of exclusivism."<br>--STEPHEN BATCHELOR<br> Author of <i>Buddhism Without Beliefs</i><br><br>"<i>The Jesus Sutras</i> vividly brings to life the partnership teachings of Jesus and their application in a surprising setting. Palmer's account of Chinese communities that honored both women and men and lived equitably and nonviolently is a fascinating story and a stunning contribution to religious history."<br>--RIANE EISLER<br> Author of <i>The Chalice and The Blade</i>,<br> <i>Sacred Pleasure</i>, and <i>Tomorrow's Children</i><br><br>"Martin Palmer has written a book in the great tradition of English scholars and explorers. He has put together the evidence of the presence of early Christianity, in the first millennium, in China. He has reread and retranslated the Jesus Sutras to present a view of Christianity that was independent of the accepted definitions in the West. He has found in this Christianity, in ancient China, a liberating and healing expression for the whole of the human spirit. Men and women of all the faith traditions will be moved by this book."<br>--ARTHUR HERTZBERG<br> Bronfman Visiting Professor of the Humanities<br> New York University<br></p><h2>Robot Dreams (Masterworks of Science Fiction and Fantasy)</h2><p>Legendary American adventurer and explorer Charles Burton Irwin, accompanied by his wife and children, builds a new life on the Western frontier, from the era of wagon trains and cattle drives to the dawn of the railroads</p><p>Isaac Asimov authored over 400 books in a career that lasted nearly 50 years.

But why have humans been given another chance at life, and who is behind it all? That's what Sir Richard Francis Burton and Sam Clemens set out to discover in two earlier novels, one by riding the "suicide express" (if you die on Riverworld, you're resurrected again at a random point along the river) and the other steaming on the greatest riverboat ever seen. Now Milton Firebrass, Clemens's former enemy and now his No. 1 lieutenant, is planning to use the dwindling iron supply on the Riverworld to create a great airship, which can fly to the North Polar Sea far more quickly than any boat can travel. There he hopes to learn the secret of the mysterious tower thought to house the beings who created this planet.<p> Jill Gulbirra does not care as much about the mission as she wants the chance to captain the great airship, which in all likelihood will be the last airship ever constructed by humankind. But in landing the coveted role, she faces stiff competition--especially from the greatest swordsman of all time, Cyrano de Bergerac, who turns out to be a natural pilot. But even if Jill can win the command of the airship and even if the ship can reach the river's headwaters, there is no guarantee it can get through the mountain wall that surrounds the tower. And it's likely that one or more agents of the Ethicals--the creators of Riverworld--are on board the airship, plotting its downfall. Worse still, somewhere along the way the airship is sure to encounter the <i>Rex Grandissimus</i>, the steamboat stolen by Sam's archnemesis, King John Lackland. <i>--Craig E. Engler</i></p>Years have passed on Riverworld. Entire nations have risen, and savage wars have been fought--all since the dead of Earth found themselves resurrected in their magnificent new homeworld. Yet the truth about the Ethicals, the powerful engineers of this mysterious "afterlife," remains unknown. But a curious cross-section of humanity is determined to change that situation . . . at any cost. <br>Intrepid explorer Sir Richard Francis Burton leads the most remarkable voyage of discovery he has ever undertaken. Hot on his heels are Samuel Clemens, King John of England, and Cyrano de Bergerac.

As director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York City, Neil deGrasse Tyson was at the center of the dispute, and he tells his side of the story with wit and humility in this audio. Mirron Willis doesn&#39;t sound entirely comfortable with the scientific language (despite a number of credits as an actor and narrator in sci-fi), but he does a fine job conveying the audiobook&#39;s humor, including the letters from children who are angry that Tyson helped to demote their favorite planet.

He is the award-winning author of The Circuit, Breaking Through, La Mariposa, and his newest novel, Reaching Out. He lives in Santa Clara, California, with his family.Jimï¿½nez' autobiographical story The <br>Circuit (1997) broke new ground <br>with its drama of a Mexican American <br>migrant child in southern <br>California.

Pope falsified his age in order to enlist in the British Merchant Navy during World War II. In action, his ship was torpedoed and he spent 14 days at sea in an open lifeboat. After being discharged due to the injuries he received, he worked as the naval and defense correspondent at the London Daily News. He turned to writing fiction at the urging of C. S. Forester, who viewed Pope as his creative heir. Author of ten non-fiction historical works as well as the 18 books in the Ramage series, Dudley Pope died in 1997.Dudley Bernard Egerton Pope was born in 1925 into an ancient Cornish seafaring family. He joined the Merchant Navy at the age of sixteen and spent much of his early life at sea. He was torpedoed during the Second World War and resulting spinal injuries plagued him for the rest of his life. Towards the end of the war Pope turned to journalism, becoming the Naval and Defence Correspondent for the &#39;London Evening News&#39;. At this time he also researched naval history and in time became an authority on the Napoleonic era and Nelson&#39;s exploits, resulting in several well received volumes, especially on the Battles of Copenhagen and Trafalgar. Encouraged by Hornblower creator CS Forester, he also began writing fiction using his own experiences in the Navy and his extensive historical research as a basis. In 1965, he wrote &#39;Ramage&#39;, the first of his highly successful series of novels following the exploits of the heroic &#39;Lord Nicholas Ramage&#39; during the Napoleonic Wars. Another renowned series is centred on &#39;Ned Yorke&#39;, a buccaneer in the seventeenth century Caribbean and then with a descendant following the &#39;Yorke&#39; family naval tradition when involved in realistic secret operations during the Second World War. Dudley Pope lived aboard boats whenever possible, along with his wife and daughter, and this was where he wrote the majority of his novels. Most of his adult life was spent in the Caribbean and in addition to using the locale for fictional settings he also wrote authoritatively on naval history of the region, including a biography of the buccaneer Sir Henry Morgan. He died in 1997 aged seventy one. &#39;The first and still favourite rival to Hornblower&#39; - Daily Mirror</p><h2>The Best Enemy Money Can Buy</h2><p>The business of lending blood money is one of the most thoroughly sordid, cold blooded, and criminal acts that were ever carried on, to any considerable extent, amongst human beings.

Do you know what&#39;s in it? Better yet, do you know what&#39;s NOT in it? We tend to think of our own era as being unaware and uninformed about American politics and history. Believe it or not, citizens in 1828 were no different. In the Preface to his book, Arthur J. Stansbury wrote this: &#34;How small a portion of the citizens of this Republic have even a tolerable acquaintance with their own Constitution... [because of] the omission of an important part of what ought to be an American education, viz, the study of the civil institutions of our country.&#34; And what was an omission in 1828 has only been further neglected in our own day. Containing 333 questions and answers, The Pocket Catechism on the Constitution is a wealth of information about the founding political document of our country. Written less than 40 years after the Constitution was ratified, the Catechism is a much-needed and welcome lesson on American politics and lawmaking. Understanding the Constitution is the first step to actually returning to it.

McGoogan, who was originallyconducting research for a novel, recognized the injustice committed against Rae.He was determined to restore the adventurer&#x2019;s rightful place in history as theman who discovered not only the grisly truth about the lost Franklin expedition,but also the final link in the elusive Northwest Passage.</p><p><em>Fatal Passage</em> is McGoogan&#x2019;s completely absorbing account of John Rae&#x2019;sincredible accomplishments and his undeserved and wholesale discreditation atthe hands of polite Victorian society. After sifting through thousands of pagesof research, maps and charts, and traveling to England, Scotland and the Arcticto visit the places Rae knew, McGoogan has produced a book that reads like afast-paced novel &#x2015; a smooth synthesis of adventure story, travelogue andhistorical biography. Fatal Passage is a richly detailed portrait of a time whenthe ambitions of the Empire knew no bounds.</p><p>John Rae was an adventurous young medical doctor from Orkney who signed onwith the Hudson&#x2019;s Bay Company in 1833. He lived in the Canadian wilds for morethan two decades, becoming legendary as a hunter and snowshoer, before he turnedto exploration. Famous for what was then a unique attitude &#x2015; a willingness tolearn from and use the knowledge and skills of aboriginal peoples &#x2015; Rae becamethe first European to survive an Arctic winter while living solely off the land.</p><p>One of dozens of explorers and naval men commissioned by the BritishAdmiralty to find out what became of Sir John Franklin and his two ships, Raereturned from the Arctic to report that the most glorious expedition everlaunched had ended with no survivors &#x2015; and worse, that it had degenerated intocannibalism. Unwilling to accept that verdict, Victorian England not onlyostracized Rae, but ignored his achievements, and credited Franklin with thediscovery of the Passage.</p><p><em>Fatal Passage</em> is Ken McGoogan&#x2019;s brilliant vindication of John Rae&#x2019;slife and rightful place in history, a book for armchair adventurers, Arcticenthusiasts, lovers of Canadian history, and all those who revel in a story of physical courage andmoral integrity. <br><br><strong>Read an opinion piece by Ken McGoogan:</strong><br><br>http://www.edmontonjournal.com/opinion1/stories/010415/5013219.html</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><strong>KEN MCGOOGAN</strong> has published more than a dozen books, among them <em>Fatal Passage</em>, <em>How the Scots Invented Canada</em>, <em>Lady Franklin&#x2019;s Revenge</em>, <em>Celtic Lightning</em> and <em>Dead Reckoning: The Untold Story of the Northwest Passage</em>.

It was Opechancanough who captured the foreign captain "Chawnzmit"&#x2015;John Smith. Smith gave Opechancanough a compass, described to him a spherical earth that revolved around the sun, and wondered if his captor was a cannibal. Opechancanough, who was no cannibal and knew the world was flat, presented Smith to his elder brother, the paramount chief Powhatan. The chief, who took the name of his tribe as his throne name (his personal name was Wahunsenacawh), negotiated with Smith over a lavish feast and opened the town to him, leading Smith to meet, among others, Powhatan&#x2019;s daughter Pocahontas. Thinking he had made an ally, the chief finally released Smith. Within a few decades, and against their will, his people would be subjects of the British Crown.</p><p></p><p>Despite their roles as senior politicians in these watershed events, no biography of either Powhatan or Opechancanough exists. And while there are other "biographies" of Pocahontas, they have for the most part elaborated on her legend more than they have addressed the known facts of her remarkable life. As the 400th anniversary of Jamestown&#x2019;s founding approaches, nationally renowned scholar of Native Americans, Helen Rountree, provides in a single book the definitive biographies of these three important figures. In their lives we see the whole arc of Indian experience with the English settlers &#x2013; from the wary initial encounters presided over by Powhatan, to the uneasy diplomacy characterized by the marriage of Pocahontas and John Rolfe, to the warfare and eventual loss of native sovereignty that came during Opechancanough&#x2019;s reign.</p><p>Writing from an ethnohistorical perspective that looks as much to anthropology as the written records, Rountree draws a rich portrait of Powhatan life in which the land and the seasons governed life and the English were seen not as heroes but as Tassantassas (strangers), as invaders, even as squatters. The Powhatans were a nonliterate people, so we have had to rely until now on the white settlers for our conceptions of the Jamestown experiment. This important book at last reconstructs the other side of the story.</p></p><p><p>Helen C.

But from morning till evening this lovable beast finds that his energy and curiosity always seem to lead him into mischief. &#x201c;Obviously written and illustrated by astute golden retriever observers, this picture book is thoroughly irresistible.&#x201d;--<i>Booklist</i><br></p><p>The late TED&nbsp;RAND&nbsp;was&nbsp;the esteemed illustrator of many picture books, including Eve Bunting's Secret Place and The Memory String.Children will see themselves in the gleeful activities of a golden retriever who finds that "it's awfully hard to be good." Throughout the day, obedience is uppermost in his mind, but there is always something to lure him from the straight and narrow: the yard beckons in the dawn light, mud puddles are too much fun to resist, the school bus is filled with friends to visit. At every turn goodness eludes him and, while he is never really a bad dog (except for chewing dad's new shoes), he is certainly a bundle of trouble. Only when fatigue descends does he achieve his goal: "And I'm all bedded down / On my favorite rug. / Finally it's time to be good." Songwriter Taylor's rhyming prose snaps along merrily, upbeat in tempo yet tinged with wry melancholy that reflects the naughty dog's exasperation. Dreamy watercolors in soft shades capture the suburban setting while drawing attention to the canine flurry of movement constantly at the center. Rand endows his lovable protagonist with facial expressions that tug at the heartstrings and, from the smiles of family and neighbors, it is obvious that this not-quite-good-as-gold-en retriever's exuberance is not held against him. Ages 4-8. <br> (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> )<br><br>PreSchool-Grade 2-A rhyming story about a fully grown, high-spirited golden retriever who has trouble behaving. Anyone who has ever raised an overgrown puppy will recognize this canine at once. He howls to go out at 5:45 A.M., comes in wet and shakes water all over his family, and rattles his food dish loudly on the floor when he's hungry. Throughout the simple text is the repeated refrain that this unruly pet asks himself, "Can I be good now?" The answer is obviously "No," until he settles on his favorite rug to be petted and hugged at day's end. "Finally it's time to be good." The rhyme rolls along in a likable, unforced way for the most part. There is no real narrative tension here. What makes the book work are Rand's illustrations rendered in watercolor, chalk, and pencil. In his brisk, assured style, he has caught this fractious dog's every mood-playfulness, boredom, shame, and remorse-and also depicts him on the move. There are hundreds of dog stories, and this one is not as involving as Lisa Campbell Ernst's Ginger Jumps (Bradbury, 1989) or as funny as Susan Meddaugh's Martha Speaks (Houghton, 1992). Still, you might make room for this endearing, exuberant pup that is unlikely to be a shelf-sitter.<br><i>Kate McClelland, Perrot Memorial Library, Greenwich, CT</i><br> (<i>School Library Journal</i> )</p><h2>Daredevil: Predator&#39;s Smile</h2><p>As a lethal arsonist stalks the city, Daredevil is forced to join forces with his deadliest foe, the Kingpin of Crime, to stop a ruthless crime boss out to seize control of the New York underworld and his bloodthirsty assassin, Bullseye.

Since the 1970s, the area has suffered mightily from deindustrialization. </p><p>Local experience, Doukas finds, has shaped an American culture of strongly egalitarian ideals. From this perspective, the region's present plight appears, to many in the region, as a betrayal of American values. Knitting together the ethnographic present, the remembered past, and the historical past, the author tracks today's discontent to the dawn of the modern corporate era for a revealing and intimate look at the rise of a new political and economic power structure.</p></p><p>"Worked Over is an ambitious book that succeeds very well.

"Let us adopt a naive attitude towards it," he proposed, "as though we were hearing it for the first time; we shall be unable then to suppress a feeling of surprise and bewilderment." After the horrors of World War II, the Holocaust, Stalinism, and Yugoslavia, Leviticus 19:18 seems even less conceivable&#x2014;but all the more urgent now&#x2014;than Freud imagined.<br><br>In <i>The Neighbor</i>, three of the most significant intellectuals working in psychoanalysis and critical theory collaborate to show how this problem of neighbor-love opens questions that are fundamental to ethical inquiry and that suggest a new theological configuration of political theory. Their three extended essays explore today's central historical problem: the persistence of the theological in the political. In "Towards a Political Theology of the Neighbor," Kenneth Reinhard supplements Carl Schmitt's political theology of the enemy and friend with a political theology of the neighbor based in psychoanalysis. In "Miracles Happen," Eric L. Santner extends the book's exploration of neighbor-love through a bracing reassessment of Benjamin and Rosenzweig. And in an impassioned plea for ethical violence, Slavoj &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek's "Neighbors and Other Monsters" reconsiders the idea of excess to rehabilitate a positive sense of the inhuman and challenge the influence of Levinas on contemporary ethical thought.<br><br>A rich and suggestive account of the interplay between love and hate, self and other, personal and political, <i>The Neighbor</i> will prove to be a touchstone across the humanities and a crucial text for understanding the persistence of political theology in secular modernity.</p><p><b>Slavoj &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek</b> is professor of philosophy at the University of Ljubljana.

These three essays creatively marshal the resources of psychoanalytic theory to address some of today&#39;s most challenging questions about individual identity, communal solidarity, and cultural conflict. In their neighborly thinking together, Zizek, Santner, and Reinhard constitute a powerful trio of advocates for reconceptualizing and redeploying neighbor-love to critique friend-enemy relations in national and global politics.

Being held in port by human agency, however, as Hayden&#x2019;s ship was, provoked quite a different response. Mr Barthe stomped about the decks impressing his juniors with his command of the English language, most especially the strain that could not be used in the presence of ladies. The other sea officers were not so vocal but peevish and too easily vexed, which was quickly sensed by the hands, who modified their behaviour accordingly.</p><p>It was Hayden&#x2019;s most urgent desire to get his ship under way on the morrow at first light and be out of Plymouth Sound and into the Channel before the decks were dry. But the forenoon had passed without the awaited permission arriving and now the afternoon was well advanced, the day speeding.</p><p>What had the First Secretary said?<i> I want you at sea&#x2014;and beyond recall&#x2014;as soon as can be arranged.</i> These words sent a little shiver through Hayden&#x2019;s entire being. &#x201c;Beyond recall&#x201d; were the words he found most ominous. Beyond recall of whom?</p><p>If only the Port Admiral would co-operate. The man&#x2019;s tardiness in granting Hayden&#x2019;s request to sail was madding if not peculiar. It caused Hayden to wonder if the Port Admiral served the designs of the &#x201c;enemies&#x201d; Hayden had been informed he possessed and if <i>that</i> was the reason the man was so dilatory in granting Hayden&#x2019;s request; orders from Whitehall Street were expected momentarily that would see him removed of his command.</p><p>Such were the thoughts that forced their way into a man&#x2019;s mind after the First Secretary informed him that if he did not accept this command it might never be within the First Secretary&#x2019;s power to gain him a comparable appointment again. Such words did speak of secret forces working against him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. did they not?</p><p>Hayden, however, was aware that his mind was not performing as it should and might be making much of nothing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or not nearly enough of what appeared to be very little. His estrangement from Henrietta had made sleep all but impossible, his stomach approved neither food nor drink, and his thoughts could hardly be turned to the matters at hand. Some part of him hoped he <i>would</i> suddenly be relieved of his command that he might return to London, find Henrietta, and have an explanation with her about the recent false claims of the Bourdages&#x2014;mother and daughter.</p><p>Hayden paced across his cabin, glancing out of the stern gallery windows now and again, across Plymouth Harbour to fields on the eastern shore. The new green of spring grass rippled in the breeze&#x2014;a fair breeze for Le Havre, to which place Hayden had been ordered to take or destroy a frigate using that harbour as a base from which to harass British shipping.</p><p>A knock on his door interrupted Hayden&#x2019;s thoughts, somewhat to his relief, as they had been tracing this same circle for several hours.</p><p>At a word from Hayden, his marine sentry cracked open the door.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr Barthe, sir&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Send him in.&#x201d;</p><p>The sailing master, all corpulence and jowls a-jiggle, waddled in, ancient hat tucked beneath his arm revealing a head of red and grey&#x2014;ash and flame.</p><p>&#x201c;Please do not tell me, Mr Barthe, that you have discovered some fatal wound to our rig.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Our rigging is all in order, sir, most perfectly so. And our sails are bent and ready to loose, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; The sailing master hesitated.</p><p>&#x201c;Do complete your sentence, Mr Barthe, the suspense is almost more than I can bear.&#x201d;</p><p>Barthe smiled. &#x201c;If we are not to sail this day, sir, Mrs Barthe and my daughters would like very much to visit the ship. Mr Wickham has kindly arranged a boat to carry them out, sir, if that would be acceptable.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did Mr Archer not inform you that we have yet to complete our powder?&#x201d;</p><p>Barthe was genuinely surprised. &#x201c;He most certainly did not, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;For which I have no explanation. The powder hoy is to visit us this very afternoon. I still hope to win our anchor at first light tomorrow and be in the Channel by breakfast.&#x201d;</p><p>Barthe did not hide his disappointment at all well. &#x201c;Perhaps&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. perhaps Mr Archer did inform me about the powder hoy, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mr Barthe, it is very obvious that you are attempting to conceal Mr Archer&#x2019;s lapse, but I shall have to have a word with him about it. As to Mrs Barthe and all the Misses Barthe, I am almost as sorry as you that they cannot visit the ship. Please send Mrs Barthe my regrets and explain the reason; I should not want her to feel the least unwelcome.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I shall, sir. Thank you, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>Barthe&#x2019;s ample bottom retreated out of the door. Hayden was sure every man aboard would be very disappointed to learn that Mrs Barthe would not be bringing her handsome daughters for a visit&#x2014;even Hayden felt a little chagrin.</p><p>Allowing the sailing master a moment to make his exit, Hayden then opened the door. &#x201c;Pass the word for Mr Archer, if you please,&#x201d; he ordered the marine.</p><p>Hayden looked at the mass of paperwork that lay in untidy piles upon his desk. If only his mind would consent to focus on it for more than five minutes before returning to Henrietta and his distressing financial troubles.</p><p>A respectful knock on the door announced the arrival of Mr Archer. The lieutenant came striding quickly in.</p><p>&#x201c;I am sorry, sir, it was entirely my failure to inform Mr Barthe. He did not for a moment forget.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And it is a very serious failure, Mr Archer. How is Mr Barthe to plan his work without such knowledge?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I do not know, sir. I shall not let such a thing happen again.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am quite certain you will not. Fires have been extinguished all about the ship?&#x201d;</p><p>Archer tried not to display offence at this but failed. &#x201c;All but the lamp in the light room, sir. And I have ordered wet blankets draped about that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Go through the ship and be certain that we have no fires lit, Mr Archer. As to Mr Barthe&#x2019;s family, or any other visitors to the ship, I should not want to take the chance of blasting them to hell. Would you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, sir, I would not.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then be about your business, Mr Archer.&#x201d;</p><p>The lieutenant went stiffly out. Although Hayden did not enjoy the role of angry captain, he had come to the belief over the years that the occasional upbraiding kept young officers on their toes and alert to their duties. It had certainly had that effect upon him. Archer&#x2019;s pride would be stung for a day or two, but Hayden was certain he would get over it and be better for it as well. There was a small part of Hayden that wondered if he was merely being peevish&#x2014;a result of his own distress and anxiety about his personal and professional life&#x2014;and this thought was not easily dismissed. He <i>was</i> peevish, he knew; the slightest things sent his choler soaring. But then, Archer&#x2019;s mistake was fairly grave and could not have been passed over without comment. He bloody well <i>should</i> have informed the sailing master that the powder hoy was expected. What had he been thinking?</p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps he was distracted by his personal life,&#x201d; Hayden muttered. &#x201c;As have you been, Captain.&#x201d;</p><p>For a moment he sank down on the bench before the windows, his mind deflecting away from duty of its own volition, and wondered again if his letter would reach Henrietta and if she would read it. His greatest worry was that she might simply burn it or toss it away out of anger with him for what she believed was his betrayal&#x2014;his reputed marriage to a French ï¿½migrï¿½e. It was a source of the utmost frustration to him that he could not have a five-minute explanation with her that would clear away all misunderstandings&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but he had not been able to find her while he was in London and neither Lady Hertle, Henrietta&#x2019;s aunt, nor Mrs Hertle, her cousin and confidante, would consent to speak with him.</p><p>Yet another knock upon his door interrupted this too familiar train of thought.</p><p>&#x201c;Boat alongside with orders from the Port Admiral,&#x201d; Midshipman Gould reported when the door was opened.</p><p>Hayden arose from the constant feeling of enervation and weight bearing down upon him and went quickly up the ladder to the deck, where he found Lieutenant Ransome speaking sharply to an unknown young officer of the same rank.</p><p>&#x201c;The Port Admiral requires your signature, Captain,&#x201d; he said as Hayden appeared. &#x201c;Mine, apparently, will not answer.&#x201d; Ransome, who had been put aboard his ship by no less a personage than Admiral Lord Hood, had the kind of pride that was rather too easily wounded&#x2014;a trait that Hayden found aggravating in a lieutenant, and especially so today.</p><p>Hayden signed the papers without comment, and discovered not just orders from the Port Admiral but a second letter from the Admiralty. He felt a need to sit, suddenly, and retreated below to the privacy of his cabin.</p><p>Sinking down into the chair at his desk, Hayden held the two letters a moment wondering which he would open first. A letter from the Admiralty was the more likely to contain bad news.</p><p>If only the Port Admiral had given me permission to sail! Hayden thought.</p><p>A moment more of wondering, his mind racing, and then Hayden came down on the side of the letter from the Admiralty. It was from Philip Stephens, and in the Secretary&#x2019;s own hand too. It was prefaced as &#x201c;Most Secret and Confidential.&#x201d;</p><p><i>My Dear Captain Hayden;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>You are hereby ordered, at the earliest opportunity of wind and weather, to take HMS Themis and proceed off the harbour of Le Havre on the night of April the 12th. At two of the morning of April the 13th, at a distance no greater than one mile due west of the headland, you must show a single light, visible to the shore, for one half of the hour. A small boat shall approach carrying an individual who will identify himself as &#x201c;Monsieur Benoï¿½t.&#x201d; He will bear information of a sensitive nature essential to the prosecution of the present war. This intelligence must then be conveyed to the Admiralty with all speed and in a manner that will not compromise the identity of its source. If this task conflicts with previous orders given to you by me, meeting Monsieur Benoï¿½t and reporting his intelligence to the Admiralty shall take precedence. These orders should not be communicated to your officers until such time as they require the information and certainly not until you are at sea and well out of sight of our shores.</i></p><p>The letter was signed &#x201c;Philip Stephens, First Secretary.&#x201d; Hayden laid it down for a moment on his desk and then cursed loud enough for his sentry no doubt to have heard. It was like the Admiralty to give him additional orders that would make the execution of his previous duties difficult if not impossible. He was also frustrated because taking a frigate could mean prize money, which, given his recent reverses, he desperately required. Meeting a spy did nothing but put his ship in danger, given that the spy could very easily be apprehended and questioned before Hayden arrived and the time and place of their rendezvous then be made known to the French authorities.</p><p>He cursed again, this time under his breath. Breaking the seal on the second letter, he found his request to sail finally had been granted. Any thoughts that he might be returned to land and the possibility of a rapprochement with Henrietta must be given over. He was for Le Havre and a meeting with the mysterious Monsieur Benoï¿½t. He cursed this particular gentleman in French.</p> <p></p><p></p><p>Two</p><p>A malformed moon drifted above the haze and cast a meagre light upon the deck. Beyond the rail, an inky, restive sea rolled and muttered in its bed.</p><p>&#x201c;It is an unwholesome sea.&#x201d; The sailing master appeared out of darkness, stomping the few feet to the bulwark where Charles Hayden stood with a night glass tucked into the crook of his arm.</p><p>&#x201c;Unwholesome? Whatever do you mean, Mr Barthe?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It seems like a broth left to stand until it has gone thick and chill.&#x201d; Barthe shivered visibly.</p><p>Hayden hid a smile. &#x201c;I believe you are becoming somewhat of a poet, Mr Barthe. It is just the usual April sea, to my eye. Though the night is too close by half.&#x201d; He raised his glass and swept it very slowly across sixty degrees of arc, then back again, before returning it to its place of rest.</p><p>&#x201c;Three hours yet, Captain, before we have some light,&#x201d; Barthe observed, divining what was in his superior&#x2019;s mind. &#x201c;Time yet.&#x201d;</p><p>Hayden did not think it was near enough time and wanted to be under sail even as they spoke.</p><p>&#x201c;I would rather see them returned sooner than later,&#x201d; Hayden replied. &#x201c;And as for the other matter&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That man might be in gaol or on his way to the guillotine. I shall not wait past the appointed time.&#x201d;</p><p>A cutter, still painted black from their recent enterprise on the island of Corsica, had set out some hours earlier to enter the French harbour of Le Havre under cover of darkness. Whether the frigate Hayden was to destroy had gone out on the hunt that night, Hayden needed to know. There was no way to intercept it along the British coast, where it stalked its prey under cover of darkness&#x2014;other than by matchless luck&#x2014;so Hayden hoped to meet with Monsieur Benoï¿½t and then lie in wait for the frigate&#x2019;s return. If, however, the French ship remained in harbour that night, Hayden did not want to lose the element of surprise by being observed lying in ambush. In that case, Hayden would order the <i>Themis</i> to slip away long before first light to take no chance of being becalmed within plain sight of the French port.</p><p>But for now he must meet this damned &#x201c;Monsieur Benoï¿½t,&#x201d; who, if he had been discovered by the French, could easily give away the time and place of this rendezvous, in which case French ships might keep the appointment instead, which caused Hayden more than a little uneasiness.</p><p>&#x201c;Can you make out the coast, Captain?&#x201d; the sailing master wondered, his voice suddenly a bit thin. &#x201c;I fear we are being set to the east. This is no place for a ship on such a dark night. When the Seine fills, upon the rise, the currents can shift inshore, and the duration of high water is often prolonged. I have seen currents set a ship counter to the best pilot&#x2019;s predictions. It is a damned dangerous situation, and I am not pleased with it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We are of one mind in this, Mr Barthe, but we have no choice in this matter.&#x201d; Hayden tu...</p></p><h2>Math in Focus, Book B Grade 3: Teacher Edition (Math in Focus: Singapore Math)</h2><p>Math in Focus Singapore Math Common Core</p><p></p><h2>The Indian Lawyer (Contemporary American Fiction)</h2><p>Sylvester Yellow Calf, a former All-Conference basketball star and promising attorney and congressman, becomes involved in blackmail through his work on the parole board</p><p>At the time of his death in 2003, James Welch was considered one of the most important authors of the American West. His books include Fool&#x2019;s Crow and Winter in the Blood.YA-- Sylvester Yellow Calf, a Blackfeet Indian lawyer, is a nontraditional character whose past and present worlds collide and then threaten to destroy him. Elements of fear are introduced in this thoughtful, evenly paced novel, not in the form of blood or violence, but rather by virtue of wrong decisions, unforeseen consequences, and the dread of loss. Yellow Calf is a fully realized character, a complex, self-made man who overcomes the adversities of parentage and poverty. He is on the verge of an unplanned political success when his very human, normal behavior in a seemingly insignificant incident sets in motion a fall from grace. Welch shifts the story's focus back and forth between a state prison and Helena, where Yellow Calf has created his own version of the American dream. His relationships with several different women add to the rich texture of the novel and provide the seeds for his undoing. As events threaten Yellow Calf's security, a fascinating third world unfolds: the reservation childhood he has tried to leave behind. It is from his past that Yellow Calf eventually finds the truth about himself and the strength to do the right thing. An absorbing psychological tale that should fascinate mature readers.<br><i>- Carolyn E.

The subject is broken down into a logical sequence of aspects and each section is generously illustrated. The furniture shown ranges from the finest examples of the period, to the sort of sturdy and workmanlike pieces which modern collectors will find afforsable. The study of oak furniture is a remarkably rich and varied subject,which reflects at several levels the social and domestic life of many generations of our ancestors. Victor Chinnery has explored and clarified many important topics, whilst fully realising that scholarship in this field is still very much in its infancy. One of the most profound influences on the appearance of furniture in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was the system of rigid demarcations operated by the different furniture making trades, and in which the work of the joiners was th</p><p></p><h2>Proust Was a Neuroscientist</h2><p>Details the contributions of an unlikely group of artists--including artist Paul Cï¿½ezanne, chef Auguste Escoffier, writer Gertrude Stein, and novelist Marcel Proust--to an understanding of the inner workings of the human brain.</p><p>Amazon Significant Seven, December 2007: Proust may have been more neurasthenic than neuroscientist, but Jonah Lehrer argues in <i>Proust Was a Neuroscientist</i> that he (and many of his fellow artists) made discoveries about the brain that it took science decades to catch up with (in Proust's case, that memory is a process, not a repository). Lehrer weaves back and forth between art and science in eight graceful portraits of artists (mostly writers, along with a chef, a painter, and a composer) who understood, better at times than atomizing scientists, that truth can begin with "what reality feels like." Sometimes it's the art that's most evocative in his tales, sometimes the science: Lehrer writes about them with equal ease and clarity, and with a youthful confidence that art and science, long divided, may yet be reconciled. <i>--Tom Nissley</i>Jonah Lehrer is editor at large for Seed magazine.

Fascinating and informative . . . bound to hook young readers." (<i>The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books</i>)</p><p>Parents may have read or heard of Mark Kurlansky's runaway bestseller <i>Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World</i>. It's an improbably fascinating story, and here, Kurlansky has teamed up with superb illustrator S.D. Schindler to tell it all over again, this time for kids. The life history of the cod--driven by its insatiable hunger--is interwoven with the insatiable hunger of people, from the Vikings onwards. The illustrations are both informative (a cross-section of the Continental Shelf, a map of the Atlantic) and humorous (comical New Englanders dancing for joy at the invention of frozen fish fingers). Along the way, the reader accidentally learns a great deal about the Vikings, the Basques, the American Revolution, the slave trade--and the current danger, once thought impossible, that the cod will be fished to extinction. Too chewy for children under about 5 or 6, this is an excellent bellyful of high-protein nonfiction for all children and even their parents.

Now Night Light, the inspired, first-ever couples&#39; devotional from Focus on the Family ministry founder Dr. James Dobson and his wife, Shirley, brings spouses together each evening, helping them stay connected with each other and their Lord. Stories that strike an emotional chord, Scripture readings, provocative questions, prayers, and personal commentary from the Dobsons encourage men and women in their homes and spiritual lives. More than just another devotional, Night Light is a practical, uplifting guide for every couple who longs to experience the joyous, intimate, &#34;three-person&#34; marriage covenant God intended.</p><p>Rising divorce rates inspired Dr. James Dobson, founder and president of Focus on the Family, and his wife, Shirley, to author a devotional for couples in an attempt to strengthen the marriages of younger generations. <i>Night Light: A Devotional for Couples</i> contains six months of daily devotions stemming from the Dobsons' 40 years of marriage experience. Beginning on Sunday, an inspirational story addresses a relevant theme, such as communication, money, forgiveness, or conflict resolution, which is expounded upon throughout the devotions for that week. Scripture, probing questions, and short anecdotes encourage intimacy between the couple in an attempt to ward off stagnation and habitual laziness in spiritual growth. While the questions and suggestions will affect every couple differently, this devotional stimulates conversation about weighty issues of the heart and turns the head toward what matters for eternity. Knowing that most couples are too exhausted by the end of the day to analyze every facet of their marriage, however, the Dobson's have crafted the devotions to be completed within 10 minutes. One would expect this to be most helpful for newlyweds, but it is a revitalizing aide for those who have had poor communication throughout their marriage or are looking to refocus their marriage on Christ. <i>Night Light</i> is a wonderful way to set your mind on the Lord before turning out the light and for drawing closer to your mate in the process. <i>--Jill Heatherly</i>Dr. James Dobson is founder and president of Focus on the Family, a nonprofit organization that produces his internationally syndicated radio programs, heard by more than 200 million people daily on over 4,200 radio stations, and publishes eleven magazines sent to more than 3 million people each month.

The Cafï¿½ Josephinum is a smell first, a stinging smell of roasted Turkish beans too heavy to waft on air and so waiting instead for the more powerful current of steam blown off the surface of boiling saucers fomenting to coffee. By merely snorting the vapors out of the air, patrons become overstimulated. The cafï¿½ appears in the brain as this delicious, muddy scent first, awaking a memory of the shifting room of mirrors second&#x2014;the memory nearly as energetic as the actual sight of the room, which appears in the mind only third. The coffee is a fuel to power ideas. A fuel for the anxious hope that the harvest of art and words and logic will be the richest ever because only the most fecund season will see them through the siege of this terrible winter and the siege of that terrible war. Names are made and forgotten. Famous lines are penned, along with not so famous lines. Artists pay their debt with work that colors some walls while other walls fall into an appealing decrepitude. Outside, Vienna deteriorates and rejuvenates in swatches, a motley, poorly tended garden. From out here, the windows of the coffeehouse seem to protect the crowd inside from the elements and the tedium of any given day. Inside, they laugh and smoke and shout and argue and stare and whistle as the milky brew hardens to lace along the lip of their cups.<br><br>A group of scientists from the university begin to meet and throw their ideas into the mix with those of artists and novelists and visionaries who rebounded with mania from the depression that follows a nation&#x2019;s defeat. The few grow in number through invitation only. Slowly their members accumulate and concepts clump from the soup of ideas and take shape until the soup deserves a name, so they are called around Europe, and even as far as the United States, the Vienna Circle.<br><br>At the center of the Circle is a circle: a clean, round, white marble tabletop. They select the Cafï¿½ Josephinum precisely for this table. A pen is passed counterclockwise. The first mark is made, an equation applied directly to the tabletop, a slash of black ink across the marble, a mathematical sentence amid the splatters. They all read the equation, homing in on the meaning amid the disordered drops. Mathematics is visual not auditory. They argue with their voices but more pointedly with their pens. They stain the marble with rays of symbolic logic in juicy black pigment that very nearly washes away.<br><br>They collect here every Thursday evening to distill their ideas&#x2014;to distinguish science from superstition. At stake is Everything. Reality. Meaning. Their lives. They have lost any tolerance for ineffectual and embroidered attitudes, for mysticism or metaphysics. That is putting it too dispassionately. They <i>hate</i> mysticism and metaphysics, religion and faith. They <i>loathe</i> them. They want to separate out truth. They feel, I imagine, the near hysteria of sensing it just there, just beyond the nub of their fingers at the end of arms stretched to their limits.<br><br>I&#x2019;m standing there, looking three hundred and sixty degrees around the table. Some of them stand out brighter than the others. They press forward and announce themselves. The mathematician Olga Hahn-Neurath is here. She has a small but valuable part to play in this script as does her husband, Otto Neurath, the over- sized socialist. Most important, Moritz Schlick is here to form the acme and source of the Circle. Olga, whose blindness descended with the conclusion of an infection, smokes her cigar while Otto drinks lethal doses of caffeine and Moritz settles himself with a brush of his lapels. The participation of the others present today is less imperative. A circle can be approximated by a handful of discrete points and the others will not be counted. There are perhaps more significant members of the Circle over the years, but these are the people who glow in color against my grainy black-and-white image of history. A grainy, worn, poorly resolved, monochromatic picture of a still scene. I can make out details if I look the shot over carefully. Outside, a wind frozen in time burns the blurred faces of incidental pedestrians. Men pin their hats to their heads with hands gloved by wind-worn skin. Inside a grand mirror traps the window&#x2019;s images, a chunk of animated glass.<br><br>In a plain, dark wooden chair near the wall, almost hidden behind the floral arm of an upholstered booth, caught in the energy and enthusiasm of that hopeful time as though caught in a sandstorm, is Kurt Gï¿½del.<br><br>In 1931 he is a young man of twenty-five, his sharpest edges still hidden beneath the soft pulp of youth. He has just discovered his theorems. With pride and anxiety he brings with him this discovery. His almost, not-quite paradox, his twisted loop of reason, will be his assurance of immortality. An immortality of his soul or just his name? This question will be the subject of his madness. Can I assert that suprahuman longevity will apply only to his name? And barely even that. Even now that we live under the shadow of his discovery, his name is hardly known. His appellation denotes a theorem; he&#x2019;s an initial, not a man. Only here he is, a man in defense of his soul, in defense of truth, ready to alter the view of reality his friends have formulated on this marble table. He joins the Circle to tell the members that they are wrong, and he can prove it.<br><br>Gï¿½del is taciturn, alone even in a crowd, back against the wall, looking out as though in the dark at the cinema. He is reticent but not unlikable. The attention with which his smooth hair, brushed back over his head away from his face, is creamed and tended hints at his strongest interest next to mathematics, namely women. His efforts often come to fruition, only adding to his mystery for a great many of the mathematicians around him. And while he has been known to show off a girlfriend or two, he keeps his real love a secret. His bruised apple, his sweet Adele.<br><br>There is something sweet about his face too, hidden as it is behind thick-rimmed goggle glasses, inverted binoculars, so that those who are drawn into a discussion of mathematics with him feel as though they are peering into a blurry distant horizon. The completely round black frames with a thick nosepiece have the effect of accentuating his eyes or replacing them with cartoon orbs&#x2014;a physical manifestation of great metaphorical vision. They leave the suggestion, with anyone looking in, that all emphasis should be placed there on those sad windows or, more important, on the vast intellectual world that lies just beyond the focus of the binocular lenses.<br><br>He speaks only when spoken to and then only about mathematics. But his responses are stark and beautiful and the very few able to connect with him feel they have discovered an invaluable treasure. His sparse counsel is sought after and esteemed. This is a youth of impressive talent and intimidating strength. This is also a youth of impressive strangeness and intimidating weakness. Maybe he has no more weaknesses than the rest of us harbor, but his all seem so extreme&#x2014;hypochondria, paranoia, schizophrenia. They are even more pronounced when laid alongside his incredible mental strengths. They appear as huge black voids, chunks taken out of an intensely shining star.<br><br>He is still all potential. The potential to be great, the potential to be mad. He will achieve both magnificently.<br><br>Everyone gathered on this Thursday, the rotating numbers accounting for some three dozen, believe in their very hearts that mathematics is unassailable. Gï¿½del has come tonight to shatter their belief until all that is left are convincing pieces that when assembled erect a powerful monument to mathematics, but not an unassailable one&#x2014;or at least not a complete one. Gï¿½del will prove that some truths live outside of logic and that we can&#x2019;t get there from here. Some people&#x2014;people who probably distrust mathematics&#x2014;are quick to claim that they knew all along that some truths are beyond mathematics. But they just didn&#x2019;t. They didn&#x2019;t <i>know</i> it. They didn&#x2019;t prove it.<br><br>Gï¿½del didn&#x2019;t <i>believe</i> that truth would elude us. He <i>proved</i> that it would. He didn&#x2019;t invent a myth to conform to his prejudice of the world&#x2014;at least not when it came to mathematics. He discovered his theorem as surely as if it was a rock he had dug up from the ground. He could pass it around the table and it would be as real as that rock. If anyone cared to, they could dig it up where he buried it and find it just the same. Look for it and you&#x2019;ll find it where he said it is, just off center from where you&#x2019;re staring. There are faint stars in the night sky that you can see, but only if you look to the side of where they shine. They burn too weakly or are too far away to be seen directly, even if you stare. But you <i>can</i> see them out of the corner of your eye because the cells on the periphery of your retina are more sensitive to light. Maybe truth is just like that. You can see it, but only out of the corner of your eye.</p><h2>The Diana I Knew: Loving Memories of the Friendship Between an American Mother and Her Son&#39;s Nanny Who Became the Princess of Wales</h2><p>This portrait from an American mother who employed a young nanny named Diana Spencer depicts a woman who became both her friend and a royal icon</p><p>Shortly after learning of Princess Diana&#39;s death in a car crash on August 31, 1997, Mary Robertson was inspired to document her memories of the princess in order to balance the &#34;mean-spirited and critical comments about her in the media coverage and certain books.&#34; The Diana Robertson first knew was an unassuming teenager who patiently and diligently cared for Robertson&#39;s young son two days a week in 1980. Robertson recalls Diana in detail, describing her first impression: &#34;She was lovely, with perfect English skin, a slight blush on her cheeks, and clear blue eyes.... She looked just like the suburban teenagers I had known in America, only ever so much prettier.&#34; She then shares the milestones of her relationship with the future princess--accidentally discovering Diana&#39;s lineage, being told by Diana of her burgeoning relationship with Prince Charles, dodging reporters together outside the Robertson home, attending the &#34;wedding of the century,&#34; visiting the princess and her sons at Kensington Palace, and, finally, attending the princess&#39;s funeral. Robertson&#39;s flattering depiction of Diana as a caring woman whose humility belied her background rings true even if the information the writer reveals about her own life is at times unnecessary and excessive.A graduate of Wellesley College and Harvard Business School, Mary Robertson lives in Morristown, New Jersey, with her husband and two children.</p><h2>Repeat After Me</h2><p><i>Repeat After Me</i> offers those who were raised in dysfunctional families characterized by abuse, addiction, other compulsive behaviors, or mental illness. This remarkable self-help workbook, takes the reader through a process of letting go of hurtful beliefs and behaviors. While insight is often the precursor to change, people need to develop skills that make change occur. Adults children tend to repeat the life scripts of their challenged, troubled families as a result of internalized beliefs and behaviors that were either modeled for them or were a part of their survival strategy. Dr. Claudia Black, world renown expert on dysfunctional families, articulates a four step process for readers to heal the wounds of their past: 1. Explore their past, for the purpose of owning the losses and grieving the pain associated with past history. 2. Connect the past history to present day life. 3. Identify and challenge internalized beliefs, differentiating between beliefs that are healthy and those useful that are self-defeating and need to be let go. 4. Learn and practice skills, focusing on the basics such as learning to listen, identifying needs and options, identifying and expressing feelings, defining successes, establishing healthy boundaries, recognizing intrusive behavior, creating healthy rituals, identifying strengths, and developing realistic expectations. This is an excellent resource to aid therapists, counselors, and other helping professionals in their work with clients to help them become aware of how their family system affected them and grow beyond it.</p><p>Repeat After Me was written in the spirit of offering all who were raised in troubled families a process of self-exploration, insight and healing that would lead to a positive change in their lives. <p>As adults began that process of asking how their childhood was influencing their present day life, the intent was never one of blame but of insight and understanding. It has been my contention that we repeat the life scripts of our family as a result of internalized beliefs and behaviors that were either modeled for us or were a part of our survivorship. We cannot put a painful past history behind us without first owning it. It is not enough to say I came from an alcoholic family or an abusive family. We must go beyond that acknowledgment to see how internalized beliefs and behaviors have shaped us to be who we are today. With that in mind Repeat After Me was written. </p><p>The knowledge that comes in owning our past and connecting it to the present is vital to developing empathy for the strength of both our defenses and skills. It also helps us to lessen our shame and not hold ourselves accountable for the pain we have carried. When we understand there are reasons for why we have lived our life as we have, and that it is not because there is something inherently wrong with who we are or that we are not bad, that understanding fuels our ongoing healing. The change we want to create in our life is made most directly as a result of letting go of old, hurtful belief systems and learning new skills. It is my hope Repeat After Me guides you in this process.</p><b>Claudia Black, PhD</b> is a world-renowned expert on addiction and codependency, best-selling author, and trainer internationally recognized for her pioneering and contemporary work with family systems and addictive disorders.

It is the story of four seekers who arrive at a notoriously unfriendly pile called Hill House: Dr. Montague, an occult scholar looking for solid evidence of the psychic phenomena called "haunting"; Theodora, his lighthearted assistant; Eleanor, a friendless, fragile young woman well acquainted with poltergeists; and Luke, the future heir of Hill House. At first, their stay seems destined to be merely a spooky encounter with inexplicable phenomena. But Hill House is gathering its powers&#x2014;and soon it will choose one of them to make its own.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Makes your blood chill and your scalp prickle. . . . Shirley Jackson is the master of the haunted tale.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>Shirley Jackson's <i>The Haunting of Hill House</i> has unnerved readers since its original publication in 1959. A tale of subtle, psychological terror, it has earned its place as one of the significant haunted house stories of the ages. <p> Eleanor Vance has always been a loner--shy, vulnerable, and bitterly resentful of the 11 years she lost while nursing her dying mother. "She had spent so long alone, with no one to love, that it was difficult for her to talk, even casually, to another person without self-consciousness and an awkward inability to find words." Eleanor has always sensed that one day something <i>big</i> would happen, and one day it does. She receives an unusual invitation from Dr. John Montague, a man fascinated by "supernatural manifestations." He organizes a ghost watch, inviting people who have been touched by otherworldly events. A paranormal incident from Eleanor's childhood qualifies her to be a part of Montague's bizarre study--along with headstrong Theodora, his assistant, and Luke, a well-to-do aristocrat. They meet at Hill House--a notorious estate in New England. </p><p> Hill House is a foreboding structure of towers, buttresses, Gothic spires, gargoyles, strange angles, and rooms within rooms--a place "without kindness, never meant to be lived in...." </p><p>Although Eleanor's initial reaction is to flee, the house has a mesmerizing effect, and she begins to feel a strange kind of bliss that entices her to stay. Eleanor is a magnet for the supernatural--she hears deathly wails, feels terrible chills, and sees ghostly apparitions. Once again she feels isolated and alone--neither Theo nor Luke attract so much eerie company. But the physical horror of Hill House is always subtle; more disturbing is the emotional torment Eleanor endures. Intense, literary, and harrowing, <i>The Haunting of Hill House</i> belongs in the same dark league as Henry James's classic ghost story, <i>The Turn of the Screw</i>. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i></p>Shirley Jackson (1919&#x2013;1965), a celebrated writer of horror, wrote many stories as well as six novels and two works of nonfiction.</p><h2>The It-Doesn&#39;t-Matter Suit</h2><p>A children&#39;s story by Sylvia Plath which was found in manuscript form after her death. Max Nix lives with his mama and papa and six brothers in a small village called Winkelburg. Max longs for a suit - not just a workaday suit, but one for doing everything. One day, a mysterious parcel arrives.</p><p>Sylvia Plath (1932-63) was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and studied at Smith College. In 1955 she went to Cambridge University on a Fulbright scholarship, where she met and later married Ted Hughes. She published one collection of poems in her lifetime, The Colossus (1960), and a novel, The Bell Jar (1963). Her Collected Poems, which contains her poetry written from 1956 until her death, was published in 1981 and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for poetry.Discovered 33 years after Plath&#39;s death, this fable tells of the desire of Max Nix to get a suit of clothes. Not an ordinary, workaday suit, but a suit for doing everything. Then, one day a mysterious parcel arrives, and Max sees a chance to get his wish. A British cast of adults and children gives a spirited presentation of this charming fable, making clear its patterns and repetition, as well as its poetic language, which will appeal to young listeners.

Following the worldwide reception of their document, the authors have expanded their themes into <i>Seeing Judaism Anew</i>. The essays in this volume offer a conceptual framework by which Christians can rethink their understanding of the church's relationship to Judaism and show how essential it is that Christians represent Judaism accurately, not only as a matter of justice for the Jewish people, but also for the integrity of Christian faith. <br><br>By linking New Testament scholarship to the Shoah, Christian liturgical life, and developments in the church, this volume addresses the important questions at the heart of Christian identity, such as: Are only Christians saved? Why did Jesus die? Why is Israel so important to Jews, and what should we think about the conflict in the Middle East? How is Christianity complicit in the Holocaust? What is important about Jesus being a Jew?</p><p><b>Mary C. Boys</b> holds the chair in Practical Theology at Union Theological Seminary in New York City.

Judaism as a Source of Christian Self-Understanding.</i>This book is written with spare understatement and great restraint, yet it makes a major statement and packs real theological power. The various essays systematically redress the past excesses and cruel distortions in Christian treatments of Judaism and articulate a respectful, honorable relationship between the two faiths. This book should be read by every Christian who wants to complete the great moral revolution of the past century which is turning Christianity into a true Gospel of Love for Jews and Judaism. The book should be read by all Jews of good will as well, for it is a source of hope and trust for a future of partnership and pluralism between the two faiths.

Yet cutting-edge studies drawing unexpected links between fathers and children are forcing us to reconsider our assumptions and ask new questions: What changes occur in men when they are "expecting"? Do fathers affect their children's language development? What are the risks and rewards of being an older-than-average father at the time the child is born? What happens to a father's hormone levels at every stage of his child's development, and can a child influence the father's health? Just how much do fathers <i>matter</i>?<br> In <i>Do Fathers Matter?</i> the award-winning journalist and father of five Paul Raeburn overturns the many myths and stereotypes of fatherhood as he examines the latest scientific findings on the parent we've often overlooked. Drawing on research from neuroscientists, animal behaviorists, geneticists, and developmental psychologists, among others, Raeburn takes us through the various stages of fatherhood, revealing the profound physiological connections between children and fathers, from conception through adolescence and into adulthood-and the importance of the relationship between mothers and fathers. In the process, he challenges the legacy of Freud and mainstream views of parental attachment, and also explains how we can become better parents ourselves. <br> Ultimately, Raeburn shows how the role of the father is distinctly different from that of the mother, and that embracing fathers' significance in the lives of young people is something we can all benefit from. An engrossing, eye-opening, and deeply personal book that makes a case for a new perspective on the importance of fathers in our lives no matter what our family structure, <i>Do Fathers Matter?</i> will change the way we view fatherhood today.</p></p><p><b>Paul Raeburn </b>is a journalist and the author of four books, including <i>Acquainted with the Night</i>.

Depending upon their budgets, the male parents-to-be might join their wives in assembling an IKEA bookcase, a global twenty-first-century bonding ritual. But while these activities can get men thinking about fatherhood, much of what prepares them to be parents was done long ago. At least three forces are at work. One is natural selection, which has shaped them to be well suited for fatherhood. The second is their own family&#x2019;s genetic inheritance, which is part of what makes each father different from all the others. And the third is diet and toxins and other factors in men&#x2019;s environments. We are now learning not only how these forces shape fathers, but how and why they can sometimes go awry.</p> <p>Not long ago, on a tranquil summer night in South Florida, I had an experience that made clear how unusual and important human fathers are. I joined scientists observing sea turtles nesting on a beach. We watched a female green turtle dig a deep hole in the sand, midway up the beach, and drop some 150 eggs, each the size of a softball, into the hole. She then buried the eggs with a rhythmic flapping of her rear legs against the sand and scuttled back to the water, leaving her young to hatch, find the ocean and food, and mature with no parental help at all.</p> <p>While she was laying her eggs, drops of a clear liquid began to fall from her eyes, as it does from many turtle mothers. Legend has it that they are crying for the children they will never know. We were moved as we stood on the beach, watching. But these secretions were not tears&#x2014;merely a way to shed excess salt that accumulates in the turtle&#x2019;s body. Crocodile mothers also cry sham tears while laying eggs&#x2014;which gave rise to the phrase &#x201c;crocodile tears&#x201d; to describe sorrowful insincerity.</p> <p>The truth is, the turtle has no regrets. Her artful use of her limbs to dig a hole and conceal her eggs represents the beginning and end of her parenting. The story is the same for many, many other species. The eggs are untended, and the young that hatch are set free to make their own way. Mothers who give birth in this fashion often produce vast numbers of offspring to combat the overwhelming odds against their survival. While the mothers&#x2019; contributions might be slight, they dwarf the contributions of males, who scarcely play any part in this primal ritual at all, beyond their brief role in conception.</p> <p>The circumstances are different for mammalian mothers&#x2014;but not so different for many fathers. Unlike newly hatched sea turtles, who are hungry and on their own from the moment they clamber out of their shells, mammals&#x2014;the warm-blooded vertebrates that include everything from shrews to human beings&#x2014;have a ready source of nutrition from their lactating mothers. The arrangement has a price, though. Newborn mammals often take a long time to mature. The mother&#x2019;s nutritional investment prevents her from bearing other offspring for a time. And, as with turtles, in most mammal species she gets little or no help from the father.</p> <p>But in the 5 to 10 percent of mammal species in which males help, the family arrangements can be strikingly different. Certain monogamous titi and night monkey fathers are among the most devoted parents in the animal kingdom. They set a standard few human fathers could meet. Titi monkey fathers provide food for their offspring and follow mothers around all day, so that whenever the babies are not nursing the fathers can carry them on their backs. By the end of the first week, the mother&#x2019;s contact with her infant during the day is limited to four or five periods of nursing. The father carries his infant 90 percent of the time. Many fathers lose weight carrying their infants around. The baby monkeys, in return, are very attached to their fathers&#x2014;experiments have shown that the infants tend to be <i>more</i> attached to their fathers than to their mothers. A titi monkey becomes more upset when separated from his father than from his mother. Infants deprived of their fathers squawk more and show a greater elevation of stress hormones than they do when deprived of mothers. And whether it&#x2019;s to be sure that he is the father of her children or just out of affection, a titi monkey father rarely lets his mate get out of his sight.</p> <p>Human fathers might not show quite the same dedication to their children and spouses, at least in terms of hours spent feeding or carrying the kids. But they are among the most committed mammalian fathers of any species on Earth. There is no example of a human society in which fathers do not help raise the children. Admittedly, some fathers are better at this than others. Some abandon their families for other mates, and some for reasons we can never be quite sure of. But most human males, at the very least, put food on the table. It would be exciting to trace the evolution of fatherhood over the past few million years to find out whether men were always as invested in their children as they are now, or how that contribution might have changed over time. Did our earliest male ancestors put time, energy, and resources into offspring who would be heavily dependent on parental care for years to come? Or did they swiftly resume the search for other willing females, to multiply again and again, increasing the chance that some of their offspring would survive? And if so, when did that change, and why?</p> <p>Those are questions we will probably never answer. We&#x2019;re not even sure exactly when, in the course of human evolution, males and females began to forge relationships with one another. But we have some hints, sifted from prehistoric remains examined by archaeologists and paleontologists. They tell us that among australopithecines&#x2014;the earliest members of the human family, who lived 4 million to 1 million years ago&#x2014;mates were involved enough for males to have provided food and care for infants and protection from predators. Long-term male-female relationships likely began with the appearance of <i>Homo erectus</i> about 1.5 million years ago. Fathers, mothers, and children slept together, so children could watch and learn from their fathers, and their fathers could protect them. In the Late Pleistocene period, about 120,000 years ago, men hunted for large game and often had multiple wives. They spent a lot of time in camp between hunts, and were often available to their children. As the Late Pleistocene period progressed, more complex technologies and art forms arose, and we know that fathers helped to transmit that culture to their children. Circumstances changed at the end of the Ice Age, about 12,000 years ago. Foraging and rudimentary farming became part of the subsistence pattern, and women contributed more to the diet, gathering vegetables. Monogamy was more common, and fathers, no longer pulled away from camp by the hunt, had more time to care for their children and grow closer to them.</p> <p>Many authorities think the increasing size of the human brain, which has grown continuously over the past 2 million years, was one reason that fathers became involved with their children. It&#x2019;s unclear why brain size increased, but it might have been to provide the social intelligence needed when human ancestors began living in larger groups. As human brains swelled in size, the bobble-headed infants who threatened to topple over under the weight of all that gray matter had to be born earlier in their development. If they got too far along in their mothers&#x2019; wombs, their brains would get so large that their skulls wouldn&#x2019;t fit through their mothers&#x2019; birth canals, a problem that can put a sudden crimp in an otherwise promising evolutionary path.</p> <p>But being born earlier had a cost&#x2014;the infants would need more care. Human children take longer than any other animal to reach the point at which they can find enough food on their own to survive. For those of you who might count calories on occasion, think about this: It takes 13 million calories&#x2019; worth of breast milk, Cheerios, and mashed peas to raise a child to the age of &#x201c;nutritional independence&#x201d; at eighteen. Mothers were not going to be able to manage that investment by themselves. They were going to need help.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>To try to fill the gap between what we would like to know about human development and what fossil remains tell us, anthropologists often turn to societies whose circumstances most resemble those of our ancestors&#x2014;namely, hunter-gatherer groups. Contemporary hunter-gatherer groups are still living much the way our ancestors did for almost all our evolutionary history. Agriculture was invented only about 10,000 years ago, and the industrial age is even more recent, beginning only a couple of centuries ago. Before that, humans were hunters and gatherers, so today&#x2019;s hunter-gatherers should be able to tell us something about fathers before the development of agriculture and industry.</p> <p>One of the most interesting such groups can be found in the western Congo River basin&#x2014;not quite the heart of Africa, but close. The landscape there is covered with a sweeping emerald-green canopy, broken by occasional patches of sun-bleached savannah. Gorillas, chimpanzees, red hogs, several varieties of monkeys, squirrels, and small antelopes called duikers wander through the canopy&#x2019;s shadows. Elephants and larger antelopes&#x2014;the sitatunga&#x2014;keep to the swampy sections near river valleys. The temperature scarcely varies, and the weather ranges from very rainy to less rainy (the &#x201c;dry&#x201d; season).</p> <p>What might seem to be a tropical paradise is actually a tough place to make a living. Hunters quickly discover that animals are scattered and hard to find. Living off the plants that grow under that green canopy isn&#x2019;t easy either; many of them are inedible. The soil isn&#x2019;t especially good for agriculture. Ecologists refer to the western Congo as &#x201c;marginal&#x201d; habitat. But it is not uninhabited. Among those who live here are the Aka pygmies, for whom this is home, a place that has been home to them and to their ancestors for so long that they have learned how to survive and prosper there.</p> <p>The Aka&#x2019;s skill at foraging and hunting with nets keeps them comfortably fed and content, with time left over. You might even say they live a life of leisure. On hunting trips, men bring their families along to help. Wives are there for more than companionship; they help to chase animals into their husbands&#x2019; nets. The parents can&#x2019;t pack the kids off to day care, so the kids come, too. The hunts are efficient, the families are almost always together, and the Aka men spend as much time with their children as they can.</p> <p>Barry S. Hewlett, an anthropologist at Washington State University Vancouver, began studying the Aka in 1973. He did not initially focus his research on Aka fathers, but that changed when he briefly left his studies of the Aka to take a job as a health coordinator for a child development agency in the United States. There he began to study the psychological literature on child development. And he realized that the Aka represented something unique. The descriptions of Western fathers&#x2019; role and behavior were completely at odds with what he&#x2019;d seen in Africa. He went back in 1984 intending to focus on the behavior of Aka fathers, and that research continues. Hewlett now has a house in an Aka village that he visits every year, for weeks or months at a time. He&#x2019;s also had occasion to practice the things he&#x2019;s learned about fatherhood; Hewlett has seven children.</p> <p>Aka parents, Hewlett quickly discovered, are different from Western parents. Hewlett observed that Aka infants are held almost constantly by someone, usually with skin-to-skin contact, because the Aka usually don&#x2019;t wear shirts. Parents and others &#x201c;talk to, play with, show affection to, and transmit subsistence skills to their infants during the day,&#x201d; Hewlett writes. Infants &#x201c;are nursed on demand, and attended to immediately if they fuss or cry.&#x201d; Children as young as a year old, Hewlett reports with some unease, are taught how to use machetes, pointed digging sticks, sharp spears, and miniature axes with sharp blades. It&#x2019;s admirable that children are given responsibility while they are young, and taught to use the tools that their parents use. However, the practice of giving metal axes to one-year-olds might not be one of the features of Aka life that we would choose to emulate.</p> <p>Despite all this attention and contact, Aka families, unlike many American families, do not let their world revolve around their children. &#x201c;American parents allow their children to interrupt their conversations with other adults; they ask their children what they want to eat and try to accommodate other desires of the children.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s what Hewlett calls a child-focused family.</p> <p>Aka society, in contrast, is adult-centered. &#x201c;Parents seldom stop their activities to pay undivided attention to their children. If an infant fusses or urinates or defecates on a parent who is talking to others or playing the drums, the parent continues his activity while gently rocking the infant or wiping the urine or feces off with a nearby leaf.&#x201d; Aka fathers spend 47 percent of their day holding their infant children or keeping within arm&#x2019;s reach of them. According to Hewlett, infants frequently crawl to their fathers, and fathers pick them up because they intrinsically enjoy infants. The babies are even part of dads&#x2019; nights out. Hewlett watched men take their kids along when they gathered in the fields to relax and drink palm wine. (Try to imagine an American father slinging his kid on his hip before heading out for a drink with the guys.)</p> <p>One morning, Hewlett watched a father named Yopo who was in bed with his eight-month-old son, Manda, when Yopo&#x2019;s wife left to fetch water for the camp. Yopo put Manda on his lap, humming to him. Manda reached for a twig on the bed and played with it. Yopo sang as if they were on a net hunt, holding Manda on his chest. Manda cuddled up to Yopo&#x2019;s neck, and Yopo put a leaf on his head. Manda squealed happily. Yopo continued to sing and hold Manda for about an hour, even after his wife returned. On another occasion, a father and a mother saw their fifteen-month-old son have a bowel movement outside, near their hut. The father dropped his work&#x2014;making string for his net&#x2014;and cleaned up the boy and the ground, using a handful of leaves. The father then sat down, resuming work on the string. His son walked toward him, put a hand on his leg, and quietly watched him work.</p> <p>One of Hewlett&#x2019;s many interesting discoveries was that Aka fathers do a lot of their child care in the evenings, when field anthropologists often aren&#x2019;t watching. The usual practice is for visiting scientists to observe when it&#x2019;s convenient, during the day. And they miss what fathers do at night. Too many anthropologists conclude fathers do little child care because they aren&#x2019;t there to see it. We can recognize this in our own families: failure to account for what fathers do at night has bedeviled studies done in industrialized countries, too. &#x201c;Infants in all cultures wake often during the night, and it is my impression that fathers are often involved in infants&#x2019; care during this time,&#x201d; writes Hewlett. Since psychological researchers don&#x2019;t generally set up observation in new families&#x2019; homes, they often miss this. They don&#x2019;t know much about the role of the father because they haven&#x2019;t seen him in action, and so they conclude that he doesn&#x2019;t do much.</p> <p>Hewlett observed that Aka fathers held their infants about 9 percent of the time during the day, but 20 percent of the time in the evenings. This is not all what we would call quality time&#x2014;the fathers with children in ...</p></p><h2>Questions and Answers (Usborne Lift the Flap Books)</h2><p>An interactive board book with over 60 flaps, exploring all kinds of questions that young children love to ask.

This investment bible remains as stimulating and meaningful as it was when it was first published 20 years ago. It's packed with ideas about stocks, living beneath your means, tax planning, retirement, and just about everything else in the financial world. And all of it is presented with Tobias's trademark brevity and ingenuity.<p> Last revised in 1995, the guide takes aim at a new game in town--online trading. By all means, use the Internet for buying a car or for research, Tobias says. But avoid cyberspace brokers, he says. Point and click enough and you will get slaughtered by commissions, spreads, taxes, and human nature. "It's so easy to click 'OK' a few times and make a $10,000 bet," he warns. "Look how mesmerized we become on a stool in front of a slot machine. Internet investing positively teases you to play." Tobias's favorite new entry is the Roth IRA, which allows you to withdraw your money tax-free when you retire. It's far better than a traditional IRA, he asserts. "Save yourself the trouble of agonizing over the choice and go with the Roth IRA," he writes. "Forget the worksheets." Sometimes caustic and always a skeptic, Tobias believes readers can shape their own financial futures. Just stick to the basics, he says. "By and large, you should manage your own money, via no-load mutual funds," he writes. "No one is going to care about it as much as you." It doesn't matter if it's 1978, 1998, or even 2008. <i>The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need</i> still is exactly that. Some things never change. <i>--Dan Ring</i></p>Andrew Tobias is the author of several bestselling books and software programs, including Managing Your Money and My Vast Fortune.

A leading international expert on Cervantes, he is the author of the <i>Penguin History of Latin America</i>.Only one of the most paradoxical men of 20th-century Spanish-language letters could have authored an equally complicated literary work such as <i>Labyrinths.</i> And Jorge Luis Borges's life (1899&#x2013;1986) imitated his art. In this dynamic biography, Spanish literature scholar Williamson (<i>The Penguin History of Latin America</i>) pieces together the life of Argentina's elusive literary master against a backdrop of the country's history and the author's oeuvre. While Borges was known as a rebel of narrative form and a crusader against conservative politics, Williamson argues that in spite of his ultracerebral writing style, he lived and died with very ordinary regrets. Borges was the son of battling parents from opposing political parties and the grandson of some of Argentina's most revered military generals. Williamson shows the young writer (whom he nicknames "Georgie" for effect) as a weakling and social recluse, unable to defend himself from the world's bullies. Ultimately, Borges chose the pen over the valiant dagger, so often used in his family's bloody history, as a means of protection. Later in life, displeased with his early books of essays, he set out to buy and burn all available copies. With just the right balance of fact and insight to make for a composed and not overly inflated biography, Williamson's psychoanalysis of Borges in love and in alienation is compelling. Replete with the most detailed facts about the air surrounding Borges, the book maintains human drama without overloading on unnecessary facts to create a poignant overview of a peculiar man. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Who is God? What is God&#x2019;s role in history? What is the nature of evil? How should I relate to God and other people? Could the universe really have a self? </p> <p>Rabbi Lawrence Kushner brilliantly reclaims a millennium of Jewish spirituality for contemporary seekers of all faiths and backgrounds. <i>God Was in This Place &amp; I, i Did Not Know </i>is about God and about you; it is about discovering God&#x2019;s place in the universe, and yours. </p></p><p><i>God Was in This Place &amp; I, I Did Not Know</i> is about seven different ways to read the Bible verse quoted in its title (Genesis 28:16). The titular verse is Jacob's exclamation upon awakening from his vision of angels ascending and descending a ladder to heaven. For centuries, readers have tried to imagine what the angels were trying to tell Jacob; Rabbi Lawrence Kushner has now surveyed some of the most illuminating reflections on that question. The book's sources range from Shmuel bar Nachmnani in third-century Palestine, to Hannah Rachel Werbermacher of Ludomir, who lived in 18th-century Poland. Kushner blends these rabbinic interpretations with his own reflections on Jacob's vision in a strong, impassioned style. <i>God Was in This Place</i> is not only about the Jacob story, however; it is, most importantly, a brilliant book about the way that Scripture offers meaning: "Biblical words shatter and rearrange themselves before our sustained gaze," Kushner writes. "As we read in Jeremiah, 'My word is like fire, says the Lord, and like a hammer that shatters the rock.'" <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><p><strong>Lawrence Kushner</strong>, author, lecturer and spiritual leader, is regarded as one of the most creative religious thinkers and writers in America. A commentator on National Public Radio's <em>All Things Considered,</em> he has focused us on spiritual renewal with wisdom and humor. Through his books and lectures, people of every faith and background have found inspiration and new strength for spiritual search and growth. It has been said that some spiritual leaders blend religion and psychology to help us walk better on the ground, but Lawrence Kushner draws on the wisdom of the mystics to help us dance better on the ceiling.</p> <p>Kushner's acclaimed books include <em>I&#x2019;m God; You&#x2019;re Not: Observations on Organized Religion &amp; Other Disguises of the Ego</em>; <em>Honey from the Rock: An Easy Introduction to Jewish Mysticism</em>;<em> Invisible Lines of Connection: Sacred Stories of the Ordinary</em>;<em> The Book of Letters: A Mystical Hebrew Alphabet</em>;<em> Jewish Spirituality: A Brief Introduction for Christians</em>;<em> </em>and<em> In God&#x2019;s Hands</em>, an inspiring fable for children, with Gary Schmidt (all Jewish Lights).</p> <p>Kushner served as rabbi at Congregation Beth El in Sudbury, Massachusetts, for almost thirty years; he is currently the Emanu-El scholar at Congregation Emanu-El in San Francisco, and an adjunct faculty member at Hebrew Union College&#x2013;Jewish Institute of Religion. He is fascinated by graphic design and computers (designing most of his Jewish Lights books). He enjoys Mozart, hanging around sailboats, and making his granddaughters giggle.</p></p><h2>The Song of Songs: A Mystical Exposition</h2><p>minor shelf wear only unused unread</p><p></p><h2>PSYCHO CYBERNETICS</h2><p>&#34;-Discover the success mechanism within you! -Improve your self-image and turn the key to a better life -Learn to utilize the power of rational thinking.....&#34;</p><p><b>Dr. Maxwell Maltz </b>(1889-1975) received his doctorate in medicine from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University in 1923. After postgraduate work in plastic surgery in Europe, Maltz was appointed to head several departments of reparative surgery in New York hospitals over his long and distinguished career. He was a prominent international lecturer on the psychological aspects of plastic surgery. He published two books on the subject,<i> New Faces, New Futures</i> and <i>Dr. Pygmalion</i>. In the 1950s, Maltz became increasingly fascinated by the number of patients who came to him requesting surgery who had greatly exaggerated "mental pictures" of their physical deformities, and whose unhappiness and insecurities remained unchanged even after he gave them the new faces they desired. In 1960, after nearly a decade of counseling hundreds of such patients, extensive research, and testing his evolving theory of "success conditioning" on athletes, salespeople, and others, he published his findings -- then radical ideas -- in the first edition of <i>Psycho-Cybernetics</i>, which went on to sell millions of copies and to be translated in dozens of languages.<b>Reviews of Maxwell Maltz&#x2019;'s original <i>Psycho-Cybernetics</i>:</b><br><br>&#x201c;Psycho-Cybernetics is a classic personal development book. Most of the current speakers in the area of personal development, including Zig Ziglar, Tony Robbins, Brian Tracy and others owe a debt to Maxwell Maltz for the foundation of their material. The psychological training of Olympic athletes is also based on the concepts in Psycho-Cybernetics. Thousands, possibly millions, of people have benefited by putting these ideas to work.

This book explores the psychology of self-image, and its profound effects on all our lives. But Maxwell Maltz goes further, and sets out an action plan to change your self-image from a disempowering one to an empowering one. Ever wondered how some people seem effortlessly successful, wealthy, fit and healthy, while others struggle and seem to get nowhere?

But what does that really mean? How do we identify and understand symbols of the Atonement? Because Jesus Christ and his Atonement are absolutely central to God s plan, our Heavenly Father has given witnesses all around us in heaven, on earth, and throughout His holy word. An ancient legal code, the high priest s sacred vestments, even the seven cities of refuge all these and more provide rich symbols of Jesus Atonement. We find types and symbols in the lives of ancient prophets and the details of modern ordinances, as well as scriptural patterns, stories, and parables that bear witness of Jesus Christ and his divine sacrifice. This remarkable book will increase our understanding of the Atonement and show how it reaches into our hearts, impacts our daily lives, and increases our desire to become like God.</p><p>Donald W.

He wrote over a dozen books, including: Soul-Centered Astrology, A Key to Your Expanding Self, Houses of the Horoscope, and Rulers of the Horoscope. An internationally known lecturer and teacher, he speaks and writes six languages and has taught in more than 30 countries.<b>The Natal Charts of Spiritually Evolved Beings<br><br>Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.<br>(Civil Rights Leader and Minister)</b><br><br>The horoscope of the late Dr. King reveals the planetary positions of a humanitarian and visionary. Perhaps one of the most remembered speeches Dr. King gave was the one in which he spoke of "going to the mountain" and there communicating with his inspiring Forces. Capricorn is, of course, the sign of the mountain climber and the position of the Sun at the M.C. certainly reveals the prominence which Dr. King would earn among his fellows. Jupiter is in the 12th House but within orb of a conjunction to the Ascendant, indicating a religious and philosophical nature. The Moon conjunct Venus in Pisces attunes one to the plight of one's fellow man while Jupiter's trine to Neptune points to a person who can work to relieve oppression. Saturn fills out the grand trine and is the lord of his 10th House, as well as the dispositor of the Sun. This position shows that Dr. King was not only aware of human suffering but (1) could establish certain plans to relieve that suffering due to an understanding of the socio-economic structure underlying it (2) could create and implement new socio-economic structures to take the place of the old; and (3) had the personal power and drive to lead his people to realize the plans he envisioned for them.<br><br>Pluto opposes the Sun and is trine the Moon from the cusp of the 4th House to the 11th. This combination of planetary influences points to Dr. King's identification with the collective consciousness of his race and his need to constantly improve the condition of blacks in the United States. His struggles would lead to his own evolutionary growth, as seen by the Sun's position and its relationship to Pluto and the Moon, as well as that of the people he was serving. The two destinies--personal and collective--are thereby seen as joined in his planetary structure.<br><br>The tendency toward the violent death that would curtail his visions, however, can also be seen in the horoscope. Uranus in the 12th House is square his 8th House Saturn while Mars opposes the latter. An unseen enemy or assassin also involved in politics would be the likely assailant (Uranus in Aries in the 12th). Although Mars and Uranus are not close enough to form a square, Mars is the dispositor of Uranus in Aries and as such is linked with its effects. Pluto's opposition to a 10th House Sun can cut short one's career, while Mars opposing the 10th House ruler, Saturn, certainly indicates the possibility of the curtailment of one's ambitions through some sudden and violent act. This is further emphasized by the Uranus square as well as the position of the Moon in relationship to Saturn and Mars. Luna is in the House of public organizations; and of hopes and wishes, which on the one hand would not reach fulfillment (Saturn square the Moon) and on the other hand could be stopped through sudden violence (Mars square the moon).<br><b>Meher Baba<br>(Religious Leader and Mystic)</b><br><br>The name Meher Baba means "compassionate father," an appellation certainly in keeping with the Baba's Sun sign, Pisces. Once again we find the Sun and Moon in close aspect with Uranus (here Sun trine and moon conjunct), indicating the potential expansion of personal consciousness to a cosmic level. Uranus's position at the Midheaven also reveals that the Baba's work would be known to a vast number of people and that he would have a definite popularity.<br><br>Scorpio (the sign of the Moon-Uranus conjunction) can give great control over oneself. Baba's self-mastery is further emphasized by Saturn's conjunction with the Moon and their trine to the Sun. These factors contributed to the Baba's ability to keep his vow of silence for many decades. His faculties of communication were far from limited, however, as Mercury's exact sextile to Jupiter would indicate. He "spoke" to vast audiences either impersonally through his voluminous writings or personally through sign language. Mars in Capricorn is midpoint the Sun and Moon, forming exact sextiles to each of the luminaries. This gave him tremendous drive as well as the magnetism to silently command a large personal following.<br><br>The Sun is square a conjunction of Pluto and Neptune. This indicates the great inner life which must have been so much a part of the man as well as his inner struggles with the various levels of energy existing in the vastness of the invisible realms. Such struggles for personal and planetary evolution are impossible to delineate, for the level of consciousness attained by such a one as the Baba is far beyond the descriptive capabilities of the writer.<br><b>Dr. Albert Schweitzer<br>(Missionary-Author-Doctor)<br></b> <br>This horoscope reveals a strong need to find and establish oneself through a total surrender to human service. The aspects in the chart which reveal this tendency are the conjunction of the Moon with Neptune and their square to the Sun-Mercury conjunction, and Pluto's trine to the Sun-Mercury. The Neptune aspects sensitize one to the entire realm of human feelings. Neptune in its particular position in the chart also gives a longing for the uncommon as well as a strong reclusive tendency. Certainly the hospital he founded in Africa provided the environment for this man's temperament.<br><br>Aries and Capricorn, the signs of Luna and Sol respectively, contribute to the need to establish something with one's own stamp on it. A need strong enough for the man to build his personal empire. But we must see here that the personal power drive revealed in this horoscope was channeled to doing good in the world and to the relief of suffering. This facet of Dr. Schweitzer's life, the direction his tremendous drives would take, cannot be judged by an examination of the natal chart. The need to devote one's energies to one's fellow man is a decision which takes place in the Soul of an individual. It is through conscious attunement to the Soul's Light that this decision can be carried forth in the material sphere of life. The natal horoscope is then the vehicle through which the Soul's energy is made manifest.<br><br>The vibrations contained in Dr. Schweitzer's Pluto trine the Sun-Mercury allows personal evolution, the "shedding of the snake's skin," to take place through his work. His being a healer is indicated by Neptune's rays, but can also be seen by Mars in Scorpio opposing Pluto. This would not only give him the desire to be in the company of death, but would give him a mitigating hand in working with the constant decomposition of the physical body which accompanies disease.<br><br>Jupiter opposing Neptune also points to a tendency to working with unfortunates, while Mars square Uranus can put one in a constantly dangerous environment. The T-square of Saturn-Mars and Uranus contributes to Dr. Schweitzer's strong self-will and determination in completing his personal goals. The grand trine of Venus-Uranus and the Moon indicates that his efforts would be supported and approved of by the masses in general, and that in spite of his natural reclusive nature, he would eventually achieve a certain amount of fame. The Capricorn Sun and Saturn sextile the Moon are aspects which reveal his devotion to his assumed responsibilities while also indicating the ability to endure great hardships.</p><h2>Sister Wendy on Prayer</h2><p>Sister Wendy Beckett, adored and renowned art historian, has spent years in silence and contemplation in her calling as a nun. Her celebrated television specials and books about art have led her many admirers to ask about her own faith and practices. For the first time, in this thoughtful examination of the nature of prayer, she reveals her deeply held beliefs about her religion and her intimate understanding of God.<br><br>What should I do during prayer? Can prayer really be as simple as a conversation? How do I let God enter my being? Do I need to belong to a religion in order to pray? Sister Wendy answers these and many other common questions, all the while imparting the importance of prayer in our daily lives. No book by Sister Wendy would be complete without art&#x2014;accompanying her wisdom are thirteen beautiful reproductions of paintings that Sister Wendy has selected because of the spiritual connection she has with each.</p><p>Born in South Africa, SISTER WENDY BECKETT felt a vocation for religious life as a child and became a nun at the age of sixteen. An acclaimed art historian, she received widespread popularity through her television series and bestselling books. She continues to live in seclusion, spending the majority of each day in prayer and silence at a Carmelite monastery in Norfolk, England.One<br><br>The Practice of Prayer<br><br>Do You Want to Pray?<br><br>One year--I forget the details--the Lenten sermons at Saint Patrick's in New York were given by a famous Jesuit who took prayer for his theme. He was much admired, but the compliment that stuck in his memory was that of an old priest who seemed to regard the very number and length of his sermons as constituting, per se, a sort of brilliant tour de force. "Because as you know, Father," he said, dropping his voice conspiratorially, "prayer's the simplest thing out." I hope the famous Jesuit did know, because the simplicity of prayer, its sheer, terrifying uncomplicatedness, seems to be the last thing most of us either know or want to know.<br><br>It is not difficult to intellectualize about prayer. Like love, beauty and motherhood, it quickly sets our eloquence aflow. It is not difficult, but it is perfectly futile. In fact, those glowing pages on prayer are worse than futile; they can be positively harmful. Writing about prayer, reading about prayer, talking about prayer, thinking about prayer, longing for prayer and wrapping myself more and more in these great cloudy sublimities can make me feel so aware of the spiritual--anything rather than actually praying. What am I doing but erecting a screen behind which I can safely maintain my self-esteem and hide away from God?<br><br>Ask yourself: what do I really want when I pray? Do you want to be possessed by God? Or to put the same question more honestly, do you want to want it? Then you have it. The one point Jesus stressed and repeated and brought up again is, "Whatever you ask the Father, He will grant it to you." His insistence on faith and perseverance are surely other ways of saying the same thing: you must really want, it must engross you. Wants that are passing, faint emotional desires that you do not press with burning conviction, these are things you do not ask "in Jesus' name"; how could you? But what you really want, "with all your heart and soul and mind and strength," that Jesus pledges himself to see that you are granted. He is not talking only, probably not even primarily, of prayer of petition, but of prayer. When you set yourself down to pray, what do you want? If you want God to take possession of you, then you are praying. That is all prayer is.<br><br>The astonishing thing about prayer is our inability to accept that if we have need of it, as we do, then because of God's goodness, it cannot be something that is difficult. Accept that God is good and that your relationship with Him is prayer, and you must conclude that prayer is an act of the utmost simplicity. Yet so many people seem to feel that there is some mysterious method, some way in that others know, but they do not. "Knock and it shall be opened to you," but they seem to believe that it needs some sort of Masonic knock and their own humble tapping will go unnoticed. What kind of God thinks of tricks, lays down arcane rules, makes things difficult? God wants to love us and to give Himself. He wants to draw us to Himself, strengthen us, and infuse His peace. The humblest, most modest, almost imperceptible rubbing of our fingers on the door, and it flies open.<br><br>Prayer is the last thing we should feel discouraged about. It concerns nobody except God--always longing only to give Himself to us in love--and our own decision. And that, too, is God's, "who works in us to will and to effect." In a very true sense, there is nothing more to say about prayer, "the simplest thing out."<br><br>God's Business<br><br>Some artists seem to me, whether consciously or not, to use images that speak of the mystery of God. Craigie Aitchison is one. A favorite theme is the holy island of Lindisfarne seen across water, but here we feel the waters are not geographical (figure 1).<br><br>This boat sails on no specific sea, but on those mythic waters that have always been our image of the mysterious unknown of living. This is not an earthly sky, any more than this is an earthly sea. The small boat, its sail taut, does not reveal who is within it. Below our curious gaze, the sailor lies hidden. This boat that seemingly sails by itself can be seen to speak of prayer.<br><br>When we pray, we are likewise carried, borne along by a power that we do not and cannot direct. It is our prayer, our boat. It is we who have launched it on this sea of faith and we who stay quiet within it. But all the movement comes from God. We await Him, we surrender to Him. Where we want to go is not to the point; it is where God wants to take us. We do not see where that is. There is starlight, yes, but no sun or moon, no clarity of vision. Our world becomes duotone: scarlet sky, purple sea. All that is in our power is choice (as it is in life, which is meant to be prayer extended): do we stay still, hidden, unable to take control, or do we jump up and steer that boat ourselves, refusing God's lordship?<br><br>Put like that, it seems so obvious, yet it can be very hard to stay in this state of powerlessness, of blindness, of vulnerability accepted, when all that holds us motionless in the boat is our trust in God. But prayer is impossible without trust. We give our time and attention only and wholly because we believe that it is Jesus who prays within us. It is He who is united to His Father and we who live in Him--and so with that divine Father. We may not feel that, or on the contrary, it may be the overwhelming certainty on which all we are is centered. Feeling or nonfeeling are equally unimportant. What matters is to stay at rest in the boat, down below sight level, while the wind that is the Holy Spirit bears us over the still waters to where the Father waits for us. "For the Son of God . . . was not Yes and No, but in him it is always Yes. For all the promises of God find their Yes in him" (2 Corinthians 1:19-20). Boat is the closest expression I have seen of making visual that sacred "Yes."<br><br>Your Unique Prayer<br><br>Prayer does not depend upon your natural capacity. What does depend upon your natural capacity is the kind of prayer, because it will be your prayer. But prayer itself is as simple as conversation between friends. No one would dare write a book on how husband and wife are to talk to each other--what topics are appropriate, what tone should be used--because obviously every marriage is different and goes through different phases. One of the responsibilities of any close relationship is that each person has to take seriously his or her need to talk, share, discuss and love. And this need will continually be changing. In prayer the relationship is between God and ourselves. God is always the same, but each of us is completely different.<br><br>The essential act of prayer is to stand unprotected before God. What will God do? He will take possession of us. That He should do this is the whole purpose of life. We know we belong to God; we know too, if we are honest, that almost despite ourselves, we keep a deathly hold on our own autonomy. We are willing, in fact very ready, to pay God lip service (just as we are ready to talk prayer rather than to pray), because waving God as a banner keeps our conscience quiet. But really to belong to God is another matter. It means having nothing left for ourselves, always bound to the will of Another, no sense of interior success to comfort us, living in the painful acknowledgement of being "unprofitable servants."<br><br>It is a terrible thing to be a fallen creature, and for most of the time we busily push this truth out of our awareness. But prayer places us helpless before God, and we taste the full bitterness of what we are. "Our God is a consuming fire," and my filth crackles as He seizes hold of me; He "is all light," and my darkness shrivels under His blaze. It is this naked blaze of God that makes prayer so terrible. For most of the time we can convince ourselves that we are good enough, good as the next man or woman--perhaps even better--who knows? Then we come to prayer--real prayer, unprotected prayer--and there is nothing left in us, no ground on which to stand.<br><br>Normally, as we grow older, we become progressively skilled in coping with life. In most departments, we acquire techniques on which we can fall back when interest and attention wilt. It is part of maturity that there is always some reserve we can tap. But this is not so in prayer. It is the only human activity that depends totally and solely on its intrinsic truth. We are there before God, or rather, to the degree that we are there before God, we are exposed to all that He is, and He can neither deceive nor be deceived. It is not that we want to deceive, whether God or anybody else, but with other people we cannot help our human condition of obscurity. We are not wholly there for them, nor they for us. We are simply not able to be so. Nor should we be. No human occasion calls for our total presence, even were it within our power to offer it. But prayer calls for it. Prayer is prayer if we want it to be.<br><br>Hunger for God<br><br>Saint Teresa of Avila, that great writer on prayer (a doctor of the Church solely because of what she said about prayer), never wearied of contemplating the story of Jesus and the Samaritan woman from Saint John's Gospel. It summed up for her what prayer was all about. And I am sorry that she would never have known far away in Spain of this great picture by Duccio, part of his masterwork for the cathedral in Siena (figure 2).<br><br>Duccio shows us an image of prayer, of the need and the hunger for God. The apostles have gone into the city to satisfy their hunger. They emerge in a compact bunch, supporting one another, protected from the clear light of His presence by the fortress of the world, their own self-sufficiency.<br><br>Their hands are full, they clasp them to themselves, satisfied hands with the food of this world in their grasp.

Gallerstein, D.V.M. Dr. Gallerstein is a practicing veterinarian and owner of Acacia Animal Hospital in Escondido, California. At Acacia, he and his associates take care of over 10,000 patients of all species, including birds, dog, cats, small mammals, reptiles and other exotic pets. Dr. Gallerstein's primary interest is birds, their medical and surgical needs as well as the education of their owners. Graduating from the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of California, Davis, in 1978, Dr. Gallerstein began developing his avian medical expertise at a large group practice in San Francisco. He has never looked back. His dedication to avian medicine has been a source of inspiration to many young students. He is an active member of many professional organizations, bird clubs and other animal-related groups. A widely requested speaker at both local and national seminars, as well as all levels of public schools, Dr. Gallerstein stays very involved in his profession. Dr. Gallerstein realized very early that many bird owners lacked informative, educational material about their birds. He took their needs very seriously, and that concern led to his becoming an author. His first book, Bird Owner's Home Health and Care Handbook, published in 1984, has been considered the standard in the bird care field since it first appeared. The goal he had of creating a practical, easy to read, complete guide for bird owners had been met. Rapid advancements in the field of avian medicine, nutrition and husbandry dictated the need for a more current reference source. Dr. Gallerstein's second book, The Complete Bird Owner&amp;s Handbook, is even more complete, yet remains as practical and "user friendly" as the first. In his spare time, he and his family enjoy the numerous outdoor activities available in southern California. Heather Acker, A.H.T. Heather was only seven years old when she decided her life's work would involve animals. Childhood dreams do come true! In addition to working in the veterinary medical field since 1974, she is a registered Animal Health Technician (A.H.T.) and has earned her community college teaching credential in animal health. Since 1982, she has been working with Dr. Gellerstein at the Acacia Animal Hospital. Her interest in birds has involved both breeding and medical aspects. In addition, her diverse background also includes working at the San Diego Wild Animal Park in the veterinary department. Heather lives with all her animals (and husband, Bob) on the Renegade Ranch in Ramona, California. Betty Byers Schmidt Betty cannot remember a time in her life when she was without a bird. She has been actively involved in breeding birds since 1968. She has owned as many as 300 birds and has handfed as many as eighty to ninety baby birds at one time. Betty believes the success of the captive-bred pet bird population is dependent upon cooperation among breeders. Sharing successes, failures and genetic information is vital to the future of pet birds. A long-term member of the Hookbill Hobbyists, a large San Diego bird club, she is currently on the board of directors. In addition, the new role of "grandma" is keeping her very busy! Christine Davis Christine has been an avian behavior consultant since 1974. She works primarily by telephone from her southern California office. The number of world-wide clientele she serves attests to the fact that bird owners are eager to understand their "feathered friends" and are willing to put both time and effort into doing so. Christine feels that the key to raising young birds properly and humanely changing undesirable behaviors of adult birds is to understand the bird's needs and motivations. She urges all animal people to truly appreciate and enjoy their special companions. Most importantly, always love them for what they are&#x2014;not for what we want them to be. Mike and Deb Morrison Mike and Deb Morrison are the owners of D &amp; M Bird Farm in San Diego, California. They are the innovators of "Aquabrood," a baby bird brooder or animal intensive care unit. They both feel the future of aviculture lies in the hands of hobbyists and professional bird breeders. In order to sustain the survival of all currently available species, breeders should specialize in at least one species for aviculture, as well as familiar "pet trade" varieties. Most importantly, breeders should strive to keep complete, accurate records, share experiences and expand their knowledge. They also need to work cooperatively with other breeders to trade offsping to help maintain viable genetic diversity. Nicole Perretta Nicole is an accomplished illustrator at the ripe "old" age of twenty-one. She has studied and drawn birds since early childhood. Nicole is a falconer and also rehabilitates injured wild birds. She is working to attain a master's degree, both in fine art and ornithology. Many of her own birds were used as models for this project.</p><h2>The Dictator Next Door: The Good Neighbor Policy and the Trujillo Regime in the Dominican Republic, 1930-1945 (American Encounters/Global Interactions)</h2><p>The question of how U.S. foreign policy should manage relations with autocratic governments, particularly in the Caribbean and Latin America, has always been difficult and complex. In <i>The Dictator Next Door</i> Eric Paul Roorda focuses on the relations between the U.S. and the Dominican Republic following Rafael Trujillo&#x2019;s seizure of power in 1930. Examining the transition from the noninterventionist policies of the Hoover administration to Roosevelt&#x2019;s Good Neighbor policy, Roorda blends diplomatic history with analyses of domestic politics in both countries not only to explore the political limits of American hegemony but to provide an in-depth view of a crucial period in U.S. foreign relations. <br>Although Trujillo&#x2019;s dictatorship was enabled by prior U.S. occupation of the Dominican Republic, the brutality of his regime and the reliance on violence and vanity to sustain his rule was an untenable offense to many in the U.S. diplomatic community, as well as to certain legislators, journalists, and bankers. Many U.S. military officers and congressmen, however&#x2014;impressed by the civil order and extensive infrastructure the dictator established&#x2014;comprised an increasingly powerful Dominican lobby. What emerges is a picture of Trujillo at the center of a crowded stage of international actors and a U.S. government that, despite events such as Trujillo&#x2019;s 1937 massacre of 12,000 Haitians, was determined to foster alliances with any government that would oppose its enemies as the world moved toward war. <br>Using previously untapped records, privately held papers, and unpublished photographs, Roorda demonstrates how caution, confusion, and conflicting goals marked U.S. relations with Trujillo and set the tone for the ambivalent Cold War relations that prevailed until Trujillo&#x2019;s assassination in 1961. <i>The Dictator Next Door</i> will interest Latin Americanists, historians, political scientists, and specialists in international relations and diplomacy. <p></p><p><br></p></p><p>In the 1930s, under the administrations of Herbert Hoover and Franklin Roosevelt, the United States government adopted a stance toward countries in the Western hemisphere that it called, optimistically, the "Good Neighbor policy." Meant to encourage the principle of self-determination and to cultivate respect for national sovereignty in a time of European imperial expansion, the policy was immediately put to the test by the rise of the Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo, who held onto power through a stunning campaign of terror against his citizens and those of neighboring Haiti. While Trujillo massacred his enemies real and imagined, the American government watched patiently--a failure to intervene that, writes historian Eric Paul Roorda, "demonstrated to a generation of Latin American dictators that they were free to run their countries however they wished, so long as they maintained common enemies with the United States: first the fascists, then the communists."<p> Trujillo made sure to keep favor in Washington by employing a powerful lobby made up of retired American military officers and industrialists. The strategy worked for decades, until Trujillo's excesses became too much to excuse. Then, Roorda writes, presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy gave aid to Trujillo's enemies, who eventually succeeded in assassinating the dictator in 1961. This well-stated, cautionary tale of foreign policy gone awry has implications for our time, and it makes for fascinating reading. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>&#34;An excellent piece of research on a topic that is both important and neglected. Roorda&#39;s determination to look at this bilateral relationship as the product of a multiplicity of actors is indeed unique.&#34;--Bruce Calder, University of Illinois at Chicago</p><h2>Breaking Creed (A Ryder Creed Novel)</h2><p><b><i>New York Times&#x2013; </i>and internationally&nbsp;bestselling author Alex Kava&#x2019;s thrilling new series introducing Ryder Creed, ex-marine turned K9 search-and-rescue dog trainer as he teams up with fan-favorite FBI profiler Maggie O&#x2019;Dell.</b><br> &nbsp;<br><br> Ryder Creed and his dogs have been making national headlines.

Her stringy hair stuck to her forehead. The room was stifling and reeked of greasy fried pork. She felt nauseated, and the smell wouldn&#x2019;t let her forget the slimy soup she had been given to coat her throat. A small dish of the golden liquid sat in front of her, its surface beaded with oil. The soup was for her benefit, Leandro had reminded her.</p><p><br>&#x201c;It contains a special medicine.&#x201d; His tone was always so gentle and reassuring. &#x201c;It will be good for your throat and make your task much easier.&#x201d;</p><p><br>Amanda knew he was right. Last week, when she did this for the first time, she didn&#x2019;t even feel what she was swallowing. It was as if her entire mouth had gone numb, just like in the dentist&#x2019;s office.</p><p><br>Still, she stared at the remaining balloons piled up on the scarred wooden tabletop, and she couldn&#x2019;t shake the sick feeling in her stomach.</p><p></p><p>Last time she had swallowed fifty-one balloons. Leandro had been so proud of her. And every single one had come out without any problems&#x2014;well, no problems meaning none had ruptured. The coming-out part had not been pain-free as Leandro had promised. But Amanda had been so relieved that she didn&#x2019;t mind the pain.</p><p><br>This time she had downed only thirty-six before the nausea hit her.</p><p><br>Leandro would be disappointed. How could she disappoint him when he had given her so much? When he had been so good to her.</p><p><br>She watched him fill the last of the balloons. He had explained to her that he used only the strongest condoms available. He told her he did it for her benefit, because he cared so much about her and because this would eliminate the risk of a balloon rupturing while inside her stomach.</p><p><br>Amanda had asked what would happen if one of the balloons did break, but Leandro had waved his hand at her as if he were swatting flies. It was a gesture that was becoming familiar, and it was usually accompanied by his favorite phrase: &#x201c;This is something you do not ask. This is something you leave to Leandro.&#x201d;</p><p><br>But now, as Amanda watched his slender fingers stretch the condom over the top of a glass vial, she wondered what would happen if one of the balloons broke inside her. Is that why she was feeling sick now? The thought made her shiver, and she forced herself to sit up straight, as if that would give the balloons in her stomach more room.</p><p><br>She tried not to think about it. Instead, she continued to watch Leandro as he carefully spooned the cocaine into each condom. When the latex tip bulged out a half inch to an inch in diameter, Leandro tied a knot, keeping it small and tight. Then he trimmed it close and neat, so there was less to swallow. When she&#x2019;d watched him last week, he had explained that this, too, was another detail he did out of concern for her.</p><p></p><p>She glanced around the room. The three swallowers and Leandro&#x2019;s partner, the old woman they called Zapata, paid no attention to Leandro. They all were focused on their own tasks in front of them. But Amanda watched how his muscles bulged under his T-shirt and yet how gentle his fingers were. He was focused on making everything easier on her, and it made her love him even more. He would never let any harm come to her. And certainly she could ignore a little stomachache.</p><p><br>She licked her lips and realized she couldn&#x2019;t feel them. Instead of panicking, she quickly reminded herself that it was only the special medicine in the soup. She must have gotten some on her lips. She tried not to think about it. She needed to calm herself. Her stomach probably wouldn&#x2019;t be upset at all if it weren&#x2019;t for the new girl. And now Amanda realized that her discomfort was definitely the girl&#x2019;s fault.</p><p><br>She&#x2019;d been crying since they brought her into the room, even while she ate the greasy soup. Pathetic sobs, all soft and quiet except for that irritating hitch to her breathing.</p><p><br>The girl was a year older than Amanda. She&#x2019;d heard Zapata tell Leandro that the girl was fifteen. She sure didn&#x2019;t act like it. She was probably just faking to get Leandro&#x2019;s attention, because now suddenly he left his work of filling the balloons and went over to her.</p><p><br>&#x201c;Lucï¿½a,&#x201d; he said gently.</p><p><br>Then he put his hand on the girl&#x2019;s back, almost a caress. Amanda stopped breathing, straining to listen as Leandro bent over and whispered something to the girl. His lips almost touched her ear. Amanda couldn&#x2019;t make out the words. She didn&#x2019;t know enough Spanish, but she couldn&#x2019;t help noticing that Leandro&#x2019;s tone sounded soothing, as if he were coaxing and persuading Lucï¿½a that everything would be okay. It was the same tone he used with Amanda.</p><p><br>Amanda grabbed another balloon from the pile. She dropped it into the small dish in front of her and rolled it around in the greasy liquid, using her fingers and not caring that they became slick, too. Then, still watching Leandro, she put it quickly into her mouth. Her throat was still numb, and she swallowed it with no problem.</p><p><br>She took another and followed the same process, just as Leandro had taught her. Then she did another and another, letting her anger sweep them down. Already her nausea started to leave. Before poor Lucï¿½a had cried and choked down two balloons, Amanda had added a half dozen. And her reward was Leandro looking over. He raised his eyebrows in surprise, then a smile transformed his entire face. By the time they were ready to leave for the airport, Amanda had swallowed two more than last week, while Lucï¿½a&#x2014;still crying and now grasping her stomach&#x2014;had managed to get down only twenty-five.</p><p><br>Amanda found herself silently telling the girl that she would never win over Leandro with such a pathetic performance. Although the older girl was so very pretty, with long, silky black hair and rich brown skin. By comparison, Amanda&#x2019;s hair was stringy and dirty blond, her face spattered with freckles that she wished she could scrub away. No matter how many balloons she swallowed, she was still jealous of the new girl. Jealous and worried that Leandro might find her more suitable because Lucï¿½a was Colombian while Amanda was just poor white American trash. That&#x2019;s what Zapata called her despite Leandro&#x2019;s scolding the old woman.</p><p><br>When Amanda had first met her, she thought Zapata was Leandro&#x2019;s mother. But there was something so cold about the old woman that Amanda didn&#x2019;t think she was capable of being a mother. Not like Amanda had much to go on. Her own mother had thrown her out of the house, told her never to come back. All because she couldn&#x2019;t keep her own boyfriend off her daughter. Her mother had caught the asshole slam-dancing Amanda against their kitchen</p><p>counter.</p><p></p><p>Instead of asking if Amanda was okay, instead of kicking the asshole out, she made Amanda leave.</p><p><br>It ended up for the better. She needed to get out of that house. And she would never have met Leandro if she hadn&#x2019;t left home. He treated her so much better. He appreciated her. And maybe after today, Zapata would also realize that Amanda was worthy of her respect.</p><p><br>At least today Zapata was screeching at Lucï¿½a. More Spanish, but Amanda didn&#x2019;t need to understand it to know that the old woman had become impatient with the new girl. Franco had come to tell them he had the van out front, and the others were already grabbing their backpacks, heading for the door.</p><p><br>Except for Lucï¿½a. She was crying even harder now, her arms wrapped tight around her stomach. Her face was streaked with sweat, not just tears. She looked as if she were in pain.</p><p><br>Amanda shuffled toward the door, watching and waiting, wanting to sit next to Leandro in the van. But his attention was focused on Lucï¿½a.</p><p><br>And then suddenly the girl collapsed, falling to the floor. Her head slammed against the heavy wooden table leg.</p><p><br>Amanda couldn&#x2019;t believe it. Was she faking it?</p><p><br>Zapata was shaking her head and saying something to Leandro, only the old woman&#x2019;s voice was eerily calm and quiet. And it was Leandro who was cursing under his breath.</p><p><br>Amanda couldn&#x2019;t take her eyes off Lucï¿½a. She couldn&#x2019;t look away. She was waiting for the girl to move, but Lucï¿½a didn&#x2019;t flinch when Leandro shoved her. There was nothing gentle about his touch now. When Lucï¿½a didn&#x2019;t respond, it only made him angrier, and Zapata grabbed his arm before he could shove at Lucï¿½a again.</p><p><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s done,&#x201d; Zapata said. &#x201c;Get it out.&#x201d;</p><p><br>Then she noticed Amanda. Her eyes widened, and Amanda thought she saw a flash of panic before the cold black eyes returned to their usual hard stare. Zapata walked toward Amanda, gesturing for her to leave, but Amanda couldn&#x2019;t stop watching Lucï¿½a and Leandro standing over her.</p><p><br>&#x201c;We must go,&#x201d; Zapata told her in a calm, steady voice as she took Amanda by the elbow. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t miss our flight.&#x201d;</p><p><br>The old woman squeezed and pulled at Amanda&#x2019;s arm to turn her toward the door, but not before Amanda saw Leandro pull a knife from his boot. He was still muttering to himself or cursing Lucï¿½a. Amanda didn&#x2019;t know which. She had never seen him like this. He didn&#x2019;t seem to notice that she was still in the room. He started cutting Lucï¿½a&#x2019;s clothing with the knife, ripping at it with urgency and anger. Was he helping her? Could he save her? Maybe it wasn&#x2019;t too late.</p><p><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s he doing?&#x201d; Amanda asked.</p><p><br>&#x201c;It is none of your concern,&#x201d; Zapata said as her fingernails dug into Amanda&#x2019;s arm and she dragged her along.</p><p><br>The old woman pushed her out the doorway, but not before Amanda saw Leandro plunge the knife again. This time into Lucï¿½a. And now Amanda knew what happened if a balloon ruptured inside her stomach.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>2<br>&nbsp;</p><p>OFF PENSACOLA BEACH, FLORIDA</p><p>OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO<br>&nbsp;</p><p>The Coast Guard helicopter pitched to one side, sending Ryder Creed sliding. He tightened his grip on Grace. His other hand white-knuckled the leather strap that kept him anchored to the inside wall. Grace was tethered to him, one end of the nylon restraint secured to her vest and the other end wrapped around Creed&#x2019;s waist. Despite never having flown in a helicopter before, she didn&#x2019;t appear stressed at all.</p><p><br>Creed, however, didn&#x2019;t have a good feeling about this trip. In fact, he was beginning to regret taking the assignment. None of his dogs had ever been in a helicopter before. He couldn&#x2019;t help thinking the sixteen-pound Jack Russell terrier felt even smaller cradled next to him.</p><p><br>But Grace was taking it in stride, already used to the thumping of the rotors and treating the roller-coaster ride as if it were just a part of the adventure. She watched and sniffed at the unfamiliar surroundings, anxious to get to work, because as soon as her vest went on, she knew they were headed for a job, and this girl loved her work. That was what made her such an excellent air-scent dog. She possessed a natural curiosity. The tougher the puzzle, the more</p><p>excited she became.</p><p><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s not exactly what I expected&#x201d; was the first thing Commander Wilson had said when he met Grace and Creed on the helipad before takeoff.</p><p><br>While Wilson handed Creed his own &#x201c;mustang&#x201d;&#x2014;the aircrew&#x2019;s term of endearment for the orange flight suits they wore&#x2014;he stared at Grace as though perhaps Creed might have brought the wrong dog. Even the rest of the crew&#x2014;copilot Tommy Ellis, flight mechanic Pete Kesnick, and rescue swimmer Liz Bailey&#x2014;looked at the terrier as if they weren&#x2019;t sure what to do with her.</p><p><br>But it was actually Grace whom the Coast Guard had requested. Last week she&#x2019;d made the national news when she managed to sniff out two kilos of cocaine at Hartsfield&#x2019;s international terminal in Atlanta. A Colombian woman had creatively found a way to make chocolate bars with cocaine centers. She had made it through customs and was headed out of the area when Grace pulled Creed off the line they were working and raced after the woman.</p><p><br>Two weeks before, Grace had stopped a duffel bag filled with a case of peanut butter. It was coming down the conveyor belt out of the cargo hold of an American Airlines flight from Iquitos, Peru. They had already spent a morning going over checked luggage from incoming international flights when Grace alerted Creed to the red-and-black duffel that looked brand-new. Sure enough, in the gooey middle of each jar was a triple-bagged stash of cocaine. Each</p><p>sixteen-ounce jar of extra-crunchy contained almost a kilo. Creed was told that the twelve-pack carton had a street value of nearly a million dollars.</p><p><br>Suddenly they were becoming celebrities. Just two days ago, Creed and Grace had traveled to prerecord an appearance on The View that was scheduled to air this week. Creed&#x2019;s partner, Hannah, was fielding calls for more appearances, on Good Morning America and Fox &amp; Friends. Grace, of course, was taking the attention the same way she reacted to everything else&#x2014;as if it were just another part of her daily adventure.</p><p><br>Creed not so much.</p><p><br>He&#x2019;d worked hard to carve out a mostly private life for himself despite building a nationally known K9 business. At first he bristled at the media attention, until Hannah convinced him it could be a way for his sister, Brodie, to find him.</p><p><br>&#x201c;Rye,&#x201d; Hannah told him when he groaned at another photo of him and Grace, this time on the front page of USA Today. &#x201c;What if Brodie is still alive? She might see you. She&#x2019;ll recognize the name, if not the face. Maybe all this is a blessing.&#x201d;</p><p><br>That was Hannah, always finding a positive spin, seeing blessings where Creed saw only chaos. That&#x2019;s how she had saved him in the first place. Seven years ago she&#x2019;d seen promise in the drunk and belligerent marine who had taken on three guys in a bar fight. It happened at the end of her shift at Walter&#x2019;s Canteen on Pensacola Beach.</p><p><br>In all his life, Creed had never had to deal with an angry black woman, especially one whose anger came in a calm and measured sermon that had sobered him more than any drill sergeant ever had. Somehow he ended up with a mop in his hands, cleaning up broken glass and sticky beer, instead of in an alley with a busted skull or broken ribs.</p><p><br>It was Hannah who&#x2019;d convinced Creed to use the skills he&#x2019;d learned as a K9 handler in his marine unit to start his own business. And since that night she&#x2019;d managed to become his business partner, his confidante, his counselor, his family. She was usually right, even about the things he didn&#x2019;t want to admit. And maybe she&#x2019;d be right about this.</p><p><br>Fifteen years ago his sister, Brodie, had disappeared, taken from an interstate rest stop. She was only eleven. Creed was fourteen. Brodie&#x2019;s body had never been found. It ripped apart his parents and forced Creed to grow up too soon, haunted and forever burdened by that autumn day when suddenly Brodie wasn&#x2019;t in the restroom anymore. She wasn&#x2019;t anywhere to be found.</p><p><br>His search for her inspired Creed to start K9 CrimeScents. The company had grown into a multimillion-dollar operation with a dozen employees, a training facility on fifty acres, with a waiting list for their services as well as for the dogs Creed trained.</p><p><br>Every cadaver search got his hopes up, because even though Brodie had disappeared as a little gir...</p></p><h2>To Forgive Design: Understanding Failure</h2><p><p>When planes crash, bridges collapse, and automobile gas tanks explode, we are quick to blame poor design. But Henry Petroski says we must look beyond design for causes and corrections. Known for his masterly explanations of engineering successes and failures, Petroski here takes his analysis a step further, to consider the larger context in which accidents occur. </p><p>In <i>To Forgive Design</i> he surveys some of the most infamous failures of our time, from the 2007 Minneapolis bridge collapse and the toppling of a massive Shanghai apartment building in 2009 to Boston's prolonged Big Dig and the 2010 Gulf oil spill. These avoidable disasters reveal the interdependency of people and machines within systems whose complex behavior was undreamt of by their designers, until it was too late. Petroski shows that even the simplest technology is embedded in cultural and socioeconomic constraints, complications, and contradictions.</p><p>Failure to imagine the possibility of failure is the most profound mistake engineers can make. Software developers realized this early on and looked outside their young field, to structural engineering, as they sought a historical perspective to help them identify their own potential mistakes. By explaining the interconnectedness of technology and culture and the dangers that can emerge from complexity, Petroski demonstrates that we would all do well to follow their lead.</p></p><p>Henry Petroski is the Aleksandar S.

This book is a litany of failure, including falling concrete in the Big Dig in Boston, the loss of the space shuttles <i>Challenger</i> and <i>Columbia</i>, the rupture of New Orleans levees, collapsing buildings in the Haitian earthquake, the <i>Deepwater Horizon</i> blowout, the sinking of the <i>Titanic</i>, the metal fatigue that doomed 1950s-era de Havilland Comet jets&#x2015;and swaying, crumpling bridges from Britain to Cambodia... [Readers will encounter] a moving discussion of the responsibility of the engineer to the public and the ways young engineers can be helped to grasp them.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Cornelia Dean</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[A] fascinating and occasionally unnerving history of engineering failures... After reading this book, one might be tempted never to venture across a bridge again. But of course that would miss Petroski&#x2019;s goal: to show how engineers learn from failure and improve their designs... For those who enjoy reading about girders and trusses, <i>To Forgive Design</i> is, yes, riveting... [Petroski] amply shows the wisdom of the proverb that failure is a good teacher. Even a collapsed bridge leads somewhere.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Matt Ridley</b><b>, </b><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Americans are encouraged to believe that failure is not an option, but author Henry Petroski regards it as just about inevitable. A professor of civil engineering and history at Duke University, Petroski began his writing career with <i>To Engineer Is Human: The Role of Failure in Successful Design</i>, an influential work that deals with mechanical and engineering failures. This huge sequel devotes much more attention to the interplay between human beings, machines, buildings and disaster. It&#x2019;s exhaustive, relentless, often exhilarating&#x2015;and given its technical nature, surprisingly readable... If you&#x2019;re already a bit phobic about flying in a plane, crossing a suspension bridge, or even driving a car, <i>To Forgive Design</i> is probably not for you... Petroski chronicles the story of failure with a measure of affection reminiscent of a biographer of Attila the Hun who develops a grudging fondness for his subject. But whether or not the latter had redeeming qualities, the former surely does: Failure reminds us to avoid the sin of pride. I thoroughly enjoyed <i>To Forgive Design</i>, even down to the gloomy quote from the famously gloomy writer Samuel Beckett: &#x2018;Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.&#x2019;&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Joe Queenan</b><b>, </b><b><i>Barron&#x2019;s</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Non-engineers needn&#x2019;t worry that the book will be too dense with details; Petroski makes the science easily understandable... [This is] a book that satisfactorily explains why our determination to push the boundaries guarantees both failure and triumph.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>James F. Sweeney</b><b>, </b><b><i>Cleveland Plain Dealer</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Engineering is interesting when it works, but much more compelling when it doesn&#x2019;t. Petroski may be one of his profession&#x2019;s establishment figures, but his key finding is highly critical: because most engineers don&#x2019;t know much about the history of engineering, complacency and gee-whizz design software is likely to foment a fairly regular incidence of potentially catastrophic structural failures... Much of the information will be of great interest to engineers and designers... The most brilliantly explained engineering failure concerns the ocean-bed blowout involving the <i>Deepwater Horizon</i> oil rig in 2010. Petroski&#x2019;s exposition is immensely detailed and benefits from being linear in its narrative. This section of the book is exemplary in its remorseless exfoliation of the technical and commercial reasons for the incident.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jay Merrick</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Independent</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Mustering a truly staggering array of examples of past engineering failures, Petroski makes the case that failure is a necessary component of technological development, and that structures, machines and other engineered devices do not exist in isolation, but instead are designed and used within a tangle of competing constraints and unpredictable scenarios... At his best, Petroski is a compelling storyteller, and his recounting of past disasters and near-disasters can be fascinating. In addition to several detailed but well-paced narratives of familiar failures such as the Space Shuttle <i>Challenger</i> explosion, the book contains a great deal of intriguing arcana... Petroski&#x2019;s greatest asset as a writer is his impressive historical erudition. He seems to have an infinite file of meticulously detailed case studies that illustrate his points, and any thought of just how long he must have spent researching inspires mild fear. He has written prolifically for nearly three decades on the topic of failure in engineering, and there is no doubt whatsoever that he knows what he&#x2019;s talking about... I would sincerely recommend <i>To Forgive Design</i> to anyone with a particular interest in historical engineering fiascos.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Colin McSwiggen</b><b>, </b><b><i>Literary Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>To Forgive Design</i> remains a largely accessible, important contribution to the growing library of failure.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Colin Dickey</b><b>, </b><b><i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;When a plane crashes or a bridge collapses, faulty engineering is the usual suspect. But in seeking the roots of failure, we should look beyond design, says engineer Henry Petroski. We must probe the political and economic imperatives that shape purposes and use. In this follow-up to his influential <i>To Engineer Is Human</i>, Petroski argues that accidents such as the <i>Deepwater Horizon</i> oil spill are the result of faults as much in &#x2018;human machinery&#x2019; as in mechanical devices. He praises software developers for learning from structural engineering about how to report and analyze mishaps.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Nature</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A rewarding read.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jonathon Keats</b><b>, </b><b><i>New Scientist</i></b></p><h2>The diary of a young girl: Anne Frank ; translated from the Dutch by B.M.

On struggling farms, in Dublin&#39;s rain-drenched streets, or in parched exile in Franco&#39;s Spain, McGahern&#39;s characters wage a confused but touching war against the facts of life.</p><p>John McGahern was the author of five highly acclaimed novels and four collections of short stories. His novel <b>Amongst Women</b><i> </i>won the GPA Book Award and the Irish Times Award, was short-listed for the Booker Prize, and was made into a four-part BBC television series. He had been a visiting professor at Colgate University and at the University of Victoria, British Columbia, and was the recipient of the Society of Authors&#x2019; Award, the American-Irish Award, and the Prix ï¿½trangï¿½re Ecureuil, among other awards and honors. His work appeared in anthologies and was translated into many languages. He died in 2006.McGahern is best known for his grim novels of Irish life, and readers of The Barracks, The Leavetaking and The Pornographer will immediately recognize his deft handiwork in these 35 stories. Operating fully within his country's vaunted short-story tradition (Frank O'Connor, Mary Lavin, et al.), McGahern meticulously builds prolonged moments of stasis, wherein accumulations of character and detail do not advance a story as much as deepen its roots. In the extraordinary "Swallows," the stultifying Irish country life is brightened for a moment by a Dublin traveler who plays Paganini on a Stradivarius, only to find his hosts asking for a bit of "Danny Boy." "Doorways," a tale of unrequited love, is formally and thematically framed by the presence of Beckettian vagabonds who offer wry but silent commentary. Although McGahern returns again and again to the same themes--emotional repression, poverty of mind and spirit, the ever-salubrious effects of stout and whiskey--he does so with an impressive and sometimes surprising range of characters (a gay fondler in "Lavin," a vulnerable translator of Chekhov and Mayakovsky in "The Beginning of an Idea"). In the end, what distinguishes McGahern's work is not his cold assessment of life in Ireland, but his ability to fan dying embers into temporary glow. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Penitent</h2><p><i>The Penitent </i>tells the story of Jospeh Shapiro, his rapid climb to prosperity, his quick plunge into promiscuity, and his subsequent flight to Israel in order to find salvation.<br></p><p><br><br>Isaac Bashevis Singer (1904&#x2013;91) was the author of many novels, stories, and children&#x2019;s books.

As the reader progresses through the sections of the book, the author demonstrates each technique with the creation of a mini painting, measuring 5-inch square. So by the time a reader has worked right through to the end, they will have an amazing collection of 50 mini paintings, on board, paper, or canvas, that will be a testament to their skill and creativity.The subject matter for these squares varies from abstracts and simple color mixing exercises, through to figurative subjects: a flower, a sunset, a busy street scene - and many more. These can be mounted, exhibited, or simply collected in a portfolio, or given away as gifts for friends to cherish.The book is ideal for anyone coming to acrylics for the first time, or keen to improve their skills, and who is sometimes daunted by the thought of filling a large empty canvas or blank piece of board. Instead, it will free painters from creative hang-ups, and replace them with an addictive desire to create that next 5-inch square! --This text refers to the Flexibound edition.</p><p>Mark Daniel Nelson studied classical sculpture and drawing at the prestigious La Scuola Classical Sculpture School and holds a degree in Visual Communications from the Colorado Institute of Art. He has taught courses in Human Anatomy, Art History, and Oil Painting at the Art Students League of Denver and at the Curtis Arts and Humanities Center. His work can be found in numerous public and private collections around the US.<p>"Anyone who has ever found themselves intimidated by a full-sized canvas or at loss as to what to fill a large painting surface with will be relieved to encounter this guide by artist Nelson. Fifty short exercises walk the reader through creating tiny five-inch square paintings of lots of different subject matter using a wide range of techniques. The small format can foster experimentation and learning, while the medium of acrylics is more immediate and easy to use than oils or watercolors. Most of the projects will take an hour or less to execute, and by the end of the book, a handsome body of work will have been produced. After an introductory chapter on tools, materials, and basic techniques, subsequent chapters present exercises to familiarize the reader with acrylics, show how to represent space realistically, how to construct abstract compositions, and how to render form and surfaces. Each two-page project features a handy sidebar, which details the specific materials used, the exact shades included in the color palette, and notes other similar projects in the book. <b>VERDICT </b>There is something here for beginning and experienced artists alike." <i><b>- Library Journal</b></i></p></p><h2>Preach for a Year 1: 104 Sermon Outlines: Two Complete Outlines for Every Sunday of the Year</h2><p>Enriching the pastor&#39;s preachng ministry with this helpful tool</p><p>Roger Campbell has been in the ministry for over thirty-five years, twenty-two of which were spent pastoring three churches.

Until recently, only a handful of these photographs had been released for publication; but now, for the first time, NASA has allowed a selection of the master negatives and transparencies to be scanned electronically, rendering the sharpest images of space that we have ever seen. Michael Light has woven 129 of these stunningly clear images into a single composite voyage, a narrative of breathtaking immediacy and authenticity that begins with the launch and is followed by a walk in space, an orbit of the Moon, a lunar landing and exploration, and a return to Earth with an orbit and splashdown. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Graced by five 45-inch-wide gatefolds that display the lunar landscape, from above the surface and at eye level, in unprecedented detail and clarity, <b>Full Moon</b> conveys on each page the excitement, disorientation, and awe that the astronauts themselves felt as they were shot into space and then as they explored an alien landscape and looked back at their home planet from hundreds of thousands of miles away. <br><br>Published on the thirtieth anniversary of Apollo 11--the first landing on the Moon--this remarkable and mesmerizing volume is, like the voyages it commemorates and re-creates, an experience both intimate and monumental.</p><p>In <i>Full Moon</i>, one of the best science photography books ever published, Michael Light presents a voyage in images to the Moon and back. Light took NASA's master negatives of photos taken by <i>Apollo</i> astronauts and scanned them electronically. The resulting pictures are so vivid they seem more clear than real life. Light orders the photos sequentially, selecting the most arresting images from each mission, to create a truly cinematic experience. In the first section, depicting blastoff, you can almost feel the violent shaking of the rocket as it strains to escape Earth's gravity. Then you <i>see</i> the quiet stillness of weightlessness, the astronauts' view down at a perfectly silent Earth, boundless oceans contrasting with bright white clouds. A spacewalk adds vertigo--the astronaut looks fragile and very alone as he floats outside his capsule far above his home planet. Then comes the waiting, as the long voyage toward the Moon continues.<p> As you watch the cratered surface get closer and closer, you have no sense of scale until you see the miniscule silver and gold lander dropping gently to land on the Moon. Leaving the cluttered interior of the capsule in bulky, awkward suits, the astronauts bring delicate tracings of color--gold on the lander; red, white, and blue on the spacesuits' flag patches--to this black-and-white world. Five huge gatefolds in this section give you indescribable views of the intricately scarred surface of the Moon.</p><p> You return to space for the reuniting of the lander and capsule, and a repetition of the tedious journey back home. Finally, you watch a chaotic splashdown in the riot of colors that is Earth. </p><p> A nice section in the back of the book explains each photo with a detailed caption, and an essay by author Andrew Chaikin (<i>A Man on the Moon</i>) adds more written context to this stunning visual experience. The book is printed on very high-quality paper, with matte black frames for the photos and a gorgeous, wordless cover.

Once again, Nin is blithely honest about her profound dishonesty, admitting that she loves telling "marvelous lies" to the men who desire her. She tires of Rank just as Miller and her husband catch up with her, then, suddenly, enters a whole new realm of potent romance with a fiery man of Inca descent, Gonzalo More. More, a man of conscience and lyrical intensity, inspires Nin to new poetic and mystical heights. These unexpurgated volumes are of particular interest to readers of the original published versions because they fill in so many puzzling omissions, but they are also remarkable for their audacity and prolificity. Just one page of Nin's extraordinary diaries contains more sex, melodrama, fantasies, confessions, and observations than most novels, and reflects much about the human psyche we strive to repress. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Adventures of the Soul: Journeys Through the Physical and Spiritual Dimensions</h2><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adventures of the Soul</i> is a manual for anyone who has ever questioned where they come from, why they are here, and where they go after they die.

I never kept a diary before, so I&#x2019;m not sure. Up till now I thought my life was too boring to think about, let alone write about, but that&#x2019;s changing. This is the second day Dad and I have spent here, and already strange things are happening. First of all, the old Willis House is the creepiest place you ever saw. It&#x2019;s got to be haunted. Dad says the old lady who owned it was really eccentric, maybe even crazy. Anyway, she died in the house&#x2014;in the front parlor where she slept because she got too old to climb the steps to her bedroom. She lay there dead for a week before anyone found her. Ugh. It seems like the perfect setup for a ghost, don&#x2019;t you think? She died there&#x2014;all alone. Think about it. I can almost see her, can&#x2019;t you? A weird old lady, white hair, a scary face, roaming around from room to room, up and down the steps, watching, waiting&#x2014;oooh, I&#x2019;m scaring myself. Do you believe in ghosts, Dear Diary?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dad definitely doesn&#x2019;t. I talked to him after dinner about Miss Willis&#x2014;that&#x2019;s the old lady&#x2019;s name&#x2014;and I asked him if he thought she haunted the house. He laughed. I hate it when he laughs at me. Like he thinks I&#x2019;m silly. Or dumb maybe. If my mother was here, I know she wouldn&#x2019;t laugh&#x2014;but she died when I was so little I can hardly remember her. Someday I&#x2019;ll write more about how much I miss her, but I don&#x2019;t want to make myself feel sad. So I will just say I wish she was here right now and we were sitting close together reading a book or something.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know this sounds odd, Dear Diary, so don&#x2019;t tell anyone, but I&#x2019;d love to see a ghost&#x2014;just to know for sure they exist. I wouldn&#x2019;t be scared. At least, I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;d be. How could a ghost actually hurt you? They&#x2019;re just ectoplasm or something, not solid.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it&#x2019;s because of my mother; maybe that&#x2019;s why I wonder so much about what happens when you die and where you go and if you can stay on earth for a while. I&#x2019;d really like to know. Now here&#x2019;s something else to tell you, something different. Not supernatural but scarier in a way because it&#x2019;s real. The first day we came to the farm, there was someone in the woods spying on us. Kids maybe. I&#x2019;m sure of it. I could feel them watching me. I swear my scalp prickled. I had the same feeling while we were eating dinner last night&#x2014;they were back, spying again. I told Dad, but he says it&#x2019;s my imagination. I&#x2019;m in a new place, I&#x2019;m not used to woods all around, I hear birds and squirrels and think they&#x2019;re people. The way he talks, you&#x2019;d think I didn&#x2019;t have an ounce of sense. Maybe I should give Dad some of my spare imagination. It might help him finish that book so he can get a better job and we can live in a house with a yard and neighbors and I can go to school and have friends&#x2014; instead of spies in the woods.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that&#x2019;s not all&#x2014;someone stole my bike last night. Dad can&#x2019;t blame that on birds or squirrels! We searched all over, but there&#x2019;s not a sign of it. My beautiful new blue bike is really and truly gone. Dad called the police and they came out and talked to us. They said teenagers sometimes sneak onto the property and most likely that&#x2019;s who took my bike. When I told them I thought someone was spying on us, one of the policemen said it must have been the same kids who stole my bike. They live in a development just across the highway from the farm. The police have had trouble with them trespassing before. The other policeman shook his head.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Funny things happen out here,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;None of the caretakers stay long. Place gives them the jitters, they say. Some of them claim it&#x2019;s haunted by the old lady who used to live here. Her and the poor&#x2014;&#x201d; The first policeman coughed and said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;d better get going, Novak. We&#x2019;ve got other business.&#x201d; I had the funniest feeling he didn&#x2019;t want us to hear what Officer Novak was about to say. In case you haven&#x2019;t noticed, that&#x2019;s how it always is with adults&#x2014;just when someone starts telling the interesting stuff, someone else shuts him up. I glanced at Dad, hoping he&#x2019;d ask Jim what he was talking about, but he was watching MacDuff chase a squirrel. Officer Novak jingled his keys and looked at me. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t go too far from the trailer,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no telling who might be hanging out in the woods. And stay away from the old house.&#x201d; &#x201c;I hear there&#x2019;s a bunch of snakes in the cellar,&#x201d; the first policeman said. &#x201c;And the floorboards are rotten in some of the rooms.&#x201d; The two of them got in the police car.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Keep your eye out,&#x201d; the first one told Dad. &#x201c;If you see anytthing suspicious, give us a call.&#x201d; Officer Novak looked at me as if something was worrying him, but all he said was, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a real nice dog you&#x2019;ve got.&#x201d; We watched them drive away. I was hoping they&#x2019;d turn their lights and the siren on, but they didn&#x2019;ttttt. I guess they only do that in movies.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now Dad thinks I might have been right about kids hiding in the woods, spying and stealing stuff. Three hundred acres&#x2014;there must be a ton of hiding places on this farm. I&#x2019;m going to look for them. If I find them, I&#x2019;ll tell them to give my bike back&#x2014;or else they&#x2019;ll end up in jail or juvenile detention. They can&#x2019;t scare me. And neither can Miss Willis.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I&#x2019;ve written so much my hand hurts, so I think I&#x2019;ll stop and read in bed for a while. It sure is dark outside. Not a streetlight. Not a house light. Not even a headlight going past.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Friend, Lissa<br><br>Copyright ï¿½ 2004 by Mary Downing Hahn.<br></p><h2>Clan Novel Setite (The Clan Novel Series)</h2><p>One Million Words of Terror <br> It began with Clan Novel: Toreador.This book, Clan Novel: Setite, is the fourth of a 13-book series concerning the Kindred the hugest event ever in the World of Darkness.From small details to grand spectacles, this epic series of over one million words reveals the secrets of this hidden world through the eyes of individuals on both sides of a great conflict.

Since Mars is their ruling planet, Aries individuals tend to be forceful, aggressive, and insistent on getting their way and winning. Although often childlike and open, they can also be hard to reach emotionally and find it difficult to express their complex feelings. They dislike being analyzed and take the attitude &#x201c;what you see is what you get&#x201d; with regard to themselves.<br><br> <b>The Aries Boss</b><br> Aries bosses are born leaders, so there will be little doubt as to their wishes concerning the direction the group should take. Explicit, clear, and demanding, these fiery individuals will ask for every ounce of commitment and energy their employees can muster, and then some. Because they are so comfortable in this role, they are eager to make decisions and see them implemented. True individuals, they naturally respect individuality in others and are surprisingly open to and even expectant of their employees acting on their own, once they understand what is expected of them.<br><br> <b>Asking the Aries Boss for a Raise</b><br> Aries bosses will probably already have anticipated you in this regard. Most likely they will offer you a raise (if you deserve it) on their own without your even asking. However, this also implies that if you need to ask for a raise you will probably be turned down. Aries bosses enjoy being magnanimous, but only if it is warranted. They are particularly impressed by the dramatic deal you may have pulled off, one that gives new spark and direction to the group. Less impressed by steady or plodding behavior, they may overlook the faithful employee who has served without attracting notice.<br><br> <b>Breaking Bad News to the Aries Boss</b><br> Make sure you wear your crash helmet. Aries bosses are likely to fly off the handle (don&#x2019;t rule out yelling, screaming, or throwing nearby objects) after an initial ominous silence. A deepening red complexion may be the second warning sign. Seismic outbursts are likely to last a few minutes but are usually gone, like summer storms, rather quickly. One alternative is simply to hand the Aries boss the disturbing report in writing and then make a quick retreat.<br><br> <b>Arranging Travel and/or Entertainment for the Aries Boss</b><br> Aries bosses are very pleased when you arrange things exactly as they would have themselves and much less than pleased when you do not. Thus, getting to know their special desires and wishes is essential to your success. Since organization is not usually their strong suit, they may depend on you entirely to have things perfectly worked out. Keep in mind that they love the grand gesture and will spare no expense to make themselves look good. Particularly observant of that little touch that indicates your sensitivity to their preferences, Aries bosses would look favorably upon those who go the extra mile, so you would do well to alert the restaurant, hotel, or travel agent of your boss&#x2019;s preferences beforehand.<br><br> <b>Decision-Making and the Aries Boss</b><br> Aries bosses naturally make all important decisions themselves, and usually without asking for your advice. That said, they like you to be decisive when it comes to your own decision-making&#x2014;just hold your breath when they are faced with what you have done. Constantly in the act of making decisions and giving orders, Aries bosses will not tolerate insubordination or misunderstanding. Nor do they change their minds often. As a result, when faced with difficulties or failures, they are likely to pin the blame on you, pointing to what they perceive as your flexibility or weakness. Better to courageously implement their doctrines and gently remind them of their original orders when the going gets rough.<br><br> <b>Impressing and/or Motivating the Aries Boss</b><br> The first step is getting your Aries boss&#x2019;s attention. This will be best accomplished not by periodic gentle memos but by a terse, well-thought-out plan that can quickly penetrate the Aries armor. This should be delivered when the two of you are alone, since taking the chance of embarrassing your Aries boss in front of coworkers is not advised. Do not try to butter up Aries bosses or deliver your spiel in a roundabout or subtle fashion; this will only make them more impatient. Once you have hurled your thunderbolt, it is best to leave them alone for a while, since they will get back to you when ready.<br><br> <b>Making Proposals and/or Giving Presentations to the Aries Boss</b><br> With Aries bosses, it&#x2019;s best to keep it short and sweet. State your points/results at the beginning rather than saving them until the end. Itemize your main points in a list of no more than five items. Do not be afraid to state the problems inherent in your plan and do not minimize the expense and effort involved. Aries bosses are attracted by challenge, and it is often the improbable or even impossible that rouses their fighting energies. Make sure that plenty of room is left for their personal involvement, without which the proposal could not succeed. Since their irritation factor is often high, try to dress in muted or neutral colors and styles.</p><h2>The Feeling Buddha: A Buddhist Psychology of Character, Adversity and Passion</h2><p>A psychotherapist who practices Zen Buddhism offers a refreshingly concise and heartfult explanation of the Buddha&#39;s Four Noble Truths, showing how Buddhism does not teach escapism or lack of emotion, but instead sees emotion as healthy and natural.</p><p>David Brazier is a practicing psychotherapist and Zen Buddhist. His previous books include Zen Therapy and Beyond Carl Rogers: Towards a Psychotherapy for the Twenty-First Century. He lives in London.Buddhism does not offer an escape from suffering, writes Zen Buddhist psychotherapist Brazier, but rather teaches us how to live "meaningfully in an afflicted world." Believing that this is but one of many widespread misconceptions regarding core Buddhist teachings, Brazier offers a new and clarifying approach to the Four Noble Truths in this commonsensical and quietly radical treatise. He begins with a fresh definition of the phrase "noble truth" itself. The "truth," he asserts, is not that life is suffering but that "suffering will always be a part of our lives." Pain and pleasure, life and death are inextricably connected, and it is this paradoxical dynamic that makes life rich and compelling. Nobility implies courage and states of mind and actions worthy of respect. What the Buddha understood, Brazier explains, is that "pride and dignity play a central role in human psychology." This helpful elucidation leads to a discussion of the Middle Path, or the Eightfold Way, that will guide Westerners to a genuine understanding of Buddhist precepts and to applying them to everyday life. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Shaker Village</h2><p>A Shaker Village is the second book in a series of Schiffer Paper Craft Projects.

And that in hunting him, they will find themselves being hunted by him, and will discover him to be the worst monster either of them has ever known.</p><p><b>Kay Hooper</b> is the award-winning, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of the Bishop / Special Crimes Unit series, including <i>Haven</i>, <i>Blood Ties</i>, <i>Blood Dreams</i>, and <i>Blood Sins,</i> and she recently launched her new series, The Bishop Files, with <i>The First Prophet. </i>She lives in North Carolina.<p><b>Chapter One</b></p><p><b>Tuesday</b></p><p>Luther Brinkman could see his breath misting before his face in the moonlight; mid-October was cold this year, even in the South. Many hardwood trees that normally showed off colorful foliage that drew tourists to the Blue Ridge were already bare-limbed and glittering with frost, and the rest boasted only dead brown leaves clinging stubbornly.</p><p>&#x201c;Shit.&#x201d; He paused and leaned against a big oak, grimacing as he adjusted the makeshift bandage around his upper thigh.</p><p>Would have been nice if it was at least a through-and-through. But no. I have to have a bullet grinding against bone every time I move.</p><p>Painfully against bone.</p><p>That was the way it felt, at least; he hadn&#x2019;t exactly gone digging around in the wound to find out for sure. Slowing the bleeding was the best he&#x2019;d been able to do. Ignoring the throbbing pain, he concentrated on controlling his breathing so he could better listen.</p><p>He couldn&#x2019;t hear the dogs any longer. That was something. Whether it signaled an end to the pursuit or only a pause was the question uppermost in his mind. It was well past midnight; the bastard might well have decided that his wounded quarry wouldn&#x2019;t get far, that waiting for daylight to resume the chase was his best bet.</p><p>Or to look for a carcass. Even way out here, it wouldn&#x2019;t be smart to leave a dead body just lying around for the wrong person to stumble across, and he wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to know just how badly he&#x2019;d wounded his quarry. Not for sure.</p><p>God knew Luther was out in the middle of nowhere, in a dense wilderness that had swallowed up more than one careless hiker and quite a few federal fugitives, never to be seen again. Even with dogs and daylight, tracking someone across this treacherous terrain would be difficult; making the attempt at night was something even the locals would consider suicidal.</p><p>But he wouldn&#x2019;t want to leave a body lying around.</p><p>Grim, Luther pushed himself away from the tree and continued on, using a thick broken limb he had found as a rough crutch. The terrain didn&#x2019;t exactly lend itself to hobbling along with a nice, steady rhythm. Or any rhythm at all. Just keeping himself upright was taking more effort and energy than he liked given the distance he had to cover in order to reach safety: the tiny mountain town he had skirted on his way up here. He had judged it to be about five miles from Jacoby&#x2019;s cabin as the crow flew.</p><p>He wasn&#x2019;t a crow and couldn&#x2019;t even begin to travel in a straight line, not with the treacherous terrain and all the obstacles of the dense forest. It wasn&#x2019;t like it was just a gentle slope downward. There were ridges and switchbacks and deep gullies gouged out of the mountain by spring and summer rains. There were boulders taller than he was, taller than a house, and dense thickets of briars and other foliage.</p><p>Working his way past or over or around took time, and it ate up distance. The ground he&#x2019;d have to cover probably included an extra mile or two at least, and that was assuming he could even last long enough to make the journey.</p><p>His mind instinctively calculated, and he tried to ignore the odds it offered him for success.</p><p>Never mind the odds. Take stock. You&#x2019;re wounded, but it isn&#x2019;t mortal and you can still use the leg. For now, at least. Dawn is hours away, so even if you can&#x2019;t reach the town you have time to put more distance between you and the maniac with the gun and every reason to want you dead.</p><p>Okay. Not too bad.</p><p>Except that safety is . . . not close. You&#x2019;ve lost a lot of blood and need medical attention. And you lost most of your gear, including the water, in that first bad fall, which was stupid but let&#x2019;s not dwell on it. You have your weapon but maybe . . . what? . . . four rounds left in the clip?</p><p>The bastard would probably come after him loaded for bear.</p><p>Bears. Don&#x2019;t think about bears.</p><p>They could smell blood. And hadn&#x2019;t he heard something about an attempt to repopulate the area with once-threatened-with-extinction wolves? Or was that farther west?</p><p>Much farther. No wolves around here. Maybe wild dogs. Even cougars have been reported. I think. Bobcats. Certainly bears. Too early to be hibernating. I think. Damn bears.</p><p>He paused again to rest, leaning against another tree, and mentally took himself to task for letting his mind linger on things there was no sense worrying about unless and until he had to.</p><p>He had the uneasy feeling that he&#x2019;d lost more blood than he had originally thought, and that was why he was having trouble focusing. Why he was light-headed and his breathing was more like panting.</p><p>Why he had to fight the urge to slide down the tree and take a real break. Maybe even a nap.</p><p>Oh, man, you are so screwed&#x2014;</p><p>&#x201c;Taking the scenic route?&#x201d;</p><p>Haven</p><p>Maggie Garrett rubbed the nape of her neck absently, then sighed when her husband&#x2019;s fingers replaced her own. &#x201c;Careful, or you&#x2019;ll put me to sleep,&#x201d; she told him wryly.</p><p>&#x201c;You need to sleep,&#x201d; John Garrett replied. &#x201c;By my count, you&#x2019;ve been up forty-eight hours at least.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I took a nap.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Twenty minutes maybe. Not nearly enough.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m okay.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, you aren&#x2019;t. You&#x2019;re never okay when one of your chicks is out of the nest.&#x201d;</p><p>A little laugh escaped her. &#x201c;One of my chicks? I think there&#x2019;s a better nickname for a six-foot-four-inch former Marine. And I think he&#x2019;d think so too.&#x201d;</p><p>John came around the desk and rested a hip on the corner so he could face her. They were in Maggie&#x2019;s office rather than the central work area of the sprawling building that was both home and business for them, and they were alone. &#x201c;Haven operatives are all your chicks, especially when one comes up missing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He should have checked in by now. He should have checked in hours ago.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Given the terrain, I doubt he could get a signal out.&#x201d; John paused, then asked deliberately, &#x201c;Not a conventional signal, at least. Have you sensed something else?&#x201d;</p><p>Maggie frowned. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have a very strong connection with Luther. It makes him uncomfortable. He&#x2019;s fine with the telepaths, but since I pick up on emotions, and he&#x2019;s still buttoned up tight . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;d rather keep his feelings to himself. Okay, I get that. With all the shit he&#x2019;s been through, I doubt most people would be eager to open up. But you&#x2019;re still sensing something?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just a vague feeling that something is wrong. Sort of a ghostly echo of pain.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Physical pain?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think so. Hard to be sure, though.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then probably not mortal pain.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, probably not.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It was a simple enough assignment,&#x201d; John said, in a thoughtful tone. &#x201c;Granted, our information put his target deep in the middle of nowhere, but hiking in there and finding him shouldn&#x2019;t have been much trouble for Luther considering his tracking and survival skills on top of his . . . psychic radar. All he had to do was get his hands on that last car we&#x2019;re certain Jacoby drove, however briefly. After that, it was only a matter of tracking him, then settling down to observe from a distance for long enough to make sure the guy wasn&#x2019;t going anywhere, then withdraw and report in. We turn the information over to Nash, and he has the location of their escaped fugitive. Our job is done. The feds can go in and get him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d; Maggie was still frowning.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well . . . didn&#x2019;t it strike you as a little odd that Agent Nash came to us?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He checked out,&#x201d; John reminded her.</p><p>&#x201c;I know he did. I know. And it made sense that, working pretty much alone out of a small field office in Tennessee, Nash didn&#x2019;t have the resources to launch a manhunt when he couldn&#x2019;t even narrow down the area in thousands of acres of wilderness.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t have the skills to do much on his own, either. He&#x2019;s pretty obviously a city boy.&#x201d;</p><p>Maggie nodded. &#x201c;And the report from the Forest Service was clear enough; without a lot more information, they couldn&#x2019;t narrow down the area enough to search effectively themselves, especially since the search dogs lost the scent about a hundred yards from that abandoned car. It was pretty much straight up a mountain from there, and what towns exist in the area are scattered, tiny, and have a well-deserved reputation for minding their own business and not being especially welcoming or forthcoming to outsiders. Especially outsiders with badges.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Remote doesn&#x2019;t begin to describe them,&#x201d; John agreed. &#x201c;In an age of instant communication, they certainly do represent almost a return to simpler times.&#x201d;</p><p>Shifting to betray a rare sign of unease, Maggie said, &#x201c;There are reports of survivalist and militia groups in that wilderness. Very credible reports. Some of the groups have been up there for years, and they aren&#x2019;t just unwelcoming to visitors; they&#x2019;re actively hostile.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Luther has too much experience not to be able to avoid that kind of potential trouble.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know, I know. But I wish now I hadn&#x2019;t sent him in alone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;One man alone, skilled and accustomed to rough terrain, could cover the distance faster and get in and out with the least chance of being detected. We agreed, and so did Luther.&#x201d;</p><p>She nodded. &#x201c;Yeah, it makes perfect tactical sense. And we had to get someone in close, since none of our operatives have the ability to pick up on Jacoby from a distance.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the sort of thing our operatives do, love. And word has spread in the last few years; we have several active cases pretty much all the time.&#x201d;</p><p>Maggie finally voiced what had been nagging at her. &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t Nash go to Bishop? That would have been the natural thing for a federal agent to do, to keep it inside the FBI. Why turn to a civilian organization when he had to know about the SCU?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Bad blood?&#x201d; John suggested after a moment. &#x201c;Bishop has made more than his fair share of enemies, and at least a few inside the bureau have been heard expressing resentment over the relative autonomy the Special Crimes Unit enjoys. Or maybe Nash simply didn&#x2019;t want his superiors to know he needed outside help to complete his assignment.&#x201d;</p><p>With a slight grimace, Maggie said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d almost rather it was the former. For a federal agent to use us and then claim the credit in locating an escaped felon is just so . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Underhanded? We always request anonymity anyway; maybe he knew that going in.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe. Still.&#x201d;</p><p>If there was anything John Garrett had learned in the last few years, it was to respect his wife&#x2019;s feelings, however vague they might seem. He leaned forward to kiss her, then said, &#x201c;Well, we can&#x2019;t report anything to Agent Nash until Luther reports in to us. But we can call Bishop.&#x201d;</p><p>Luther found himself staring down the business end of a shotgun, all too clear in the moonlight. He actually had to force himself to lift his gaze from the barrels and focus on the woman holding the weapon.</p><p>&#x201c;Taking the scenic route?&#x201d; she repeated, her tone calm.</p><p>The angle made it impossible for him to see her face; she wore jeans and a warm jacket with a fur-trimmed hood pulled up.</p><p>He envied her the hood; he thought his ears might be frozen.</p><p>If he&#x2019;d had two solid legs under him, Luther probably would have handled the situation differently, but as it was he judged he had little choice. The light-headedness was getting worse. &#x201c;Ran into a little trouble hiking,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>In the same calm tone, she said, &#x201c;Yeah, people run into bullets all the time in these mountains. Especially miles off the hiking trails and on private land. Posted private land. Anybody comes way up here to live, they generally prefer to be left alone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A simple &#x2018;Go away&#x2019; would have been enough.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what the No Trespassing signs were for. Or did you manage to miss all of them?&#x201d;</p><p>He decided, after backtracking a bit mentally, that he had missed the important point, and added, &#x201c;How do you know it&#x2019;s a bullet wound? I might have fallen or . . . something.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Looks like you&#x2019;re about to fall on your ass,&#x201d; she said. Then added, &#x201c;That gun come with a badge?&#x201d;</p><p>He wondered how she could see his handgun, since it was in a shoulder holster inside his zipped jacket. &#x201c;Sort of.&#x201d;</p><p>The barrels of the shotgun lifted until they were pointed at his face. &#x201c;Either you have a badge or you don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Private investigator,&#x201d; he said, hoping he wasn&#x2019;t tripping over syllables in his haste to get the words out. &#x201c;Licensed. Hired to locate an escaped fugitive.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Escaped from where?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Uh . . . Virginia. Federal custody in Virginia.&#x201d;</p><p>And they sent a civilian after him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not at first. I mean . . . there were state cops and FBI and maybe marshals, I dunno. Bunch of people. Tracking dogs. But he gave them all the slip. And in these mountains . . . Well, fugitives have gone missing pretty much forever.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So you were hired.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m good at this sort of thing,&#x201d; he said, wryly aware of the irony that drove him to add, &#x201c;usually.&#x201d;</p><p>But all she said was, &#x201c;And did you locate him?&#x201d;</p><p>He had to think about that for a minute, aware of the vague notion that just because she had a gun in his face it didn&#x2019;t mean he had to tell her everything. In fact, it actually meant he shouldn&#x2019;t tell her anything.</p><p>Name, rank, serial number.</p><p>He remembered the drill.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he heard himself say. &#x201c;But I was just supposed to find him and report in, that&#x2019;s all. Sneaky bastard slipped around behind me when I was waiting for it to get dark enough for me to leave without being seen. After that, I was just trying to get away from him and his dogs.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Cole Jacoby.&#x201d;</p><p>He had the odd, fuzzy thought that she wasn&#x2019;t providing information so much as probing to find out what he knew. Except . . . he also felt she didn&#x2019;t have to do that. For some reason. What reason? &#x201c;You know that because you&#x2019;re neighbors?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That. There aren&#x2019;t many of us up here this time of year. And I heard his dogs. Around here, we usually keep our dogs in at night&#x2014;unless there&#x2019;s something we need to run off.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Which is why you came out here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I also heard shots. And the whole area is posted no hunting. Besides which, it wasn&#x2019;t rifle fire I heard.&#x201d;</p><p>Luther wondered why she was now aiming the shotgun above his head, and realized only then that he was sliding slowly down the tree at his back. His legs felt like rubber.</p><p>&#x201c;Shots. Uh-huh. Those would have been him shooting at me, and me . . . returning fire. I wasn&#x2019;t supposed to shoot him, so . . . I didn&#x2019;t try to hit him. He didn&#x2019;t . . . grant me . . . the same . . . courtesy.&#x201d; He shook his head to try to clear his vision. &#x201c;Jesus, you&#x2019;re tall.&#x201d;</p><p>A sigh misted in the air in front of the face he still couldn&#x2019;t make out, and she lowered the shotgun until the barrels pointed downward. &#x201c;No, you&#x2019;re tall. And heavy. And it&#x2019;s going to be a bitch getting you back to my place.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are we going to your place? That . . . sounds like . . . a plan.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A plan that would work better if you didn&#x2019;t pass out along the way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Me? Pass out? Nah, I&#x2019;m . . . fine. Just need to rest a little . . . while. And . . . I&#x2019;ll be . . . good as . . . new.&#x201d;</p><p>She bent toward him, and he tried really hard to see her face. But all he caught was the almost eerie gleam of her eyes.</p><p>You&#x2019;ve got a ways to go before you&#x2019;re as good as new, pal.</p><p>It was the last thing he remembered, wondering if that had been his thought&#x2014;or hers.</p></p><h2>Water Bugs and Dragonflies: Explaining Death to Young Children</h2><p>How can we answer the many questions young children have about death?

His diaries, kept from the age of eight, make it clear that he was openly homosexual from his late teens, but until the age of 42 he lived and worked in his mother&#x2019;s L.A. rooming house, where his strict ethical code prevented him from fully expressing his fantasies. For 24 years he worked in black and white and never showed a completely naked man, but following his mother&#x2019;s death in 1964 Mizer built a kingdom dedicated to the pleasures of male flesh, and photographed fully nude men in explicit poses and psychedelically saturated colors.<br> <br> In the 1970s and &#x2019;80s Bob Mizer&#x2019;s compound, centered around the old rooming house, became home to dozens of his young models, who lived outdoors on couches and porch gliders among the chickens, geese, goats and monkeys, Roman statuary, cast off Christmas trees and other sundry props that featured in his increasingly quirky films and photography.<br> <br> Sometimes called <strong>the Hugh Hefner of gay publishing</strong> for his pioneering magazine (republished in entirety by TASCHEN in 1997), Mizer influenced figures in art and society from David Hockney&#x2013;who first came to America partly to meet Bob Mizer&#x2013;to California governor <strong>Arnold Schwarzenegge</strong><strong>r</strong>, who modeled for Mizer in 1975.<br> <br> <em>Bob&#x2019;s World: The Life and Boys of AMG&#x2019;s Bob Mizer</em> is the first book to celebrate the full-color, deliriously uninhibited carnival of late-period Mizer.

George Gilder&#39;s global best-seller ?Wealth and Poverty? made the moral case for capitalism. Now Gilder makes the case for Israel, portraying a conflict of barbarism and envy against civilization and creativity. Gilder reveals Israel as a leader of human civilization, technological progress, and scientific advance. Tiny Israel stands behind only the United States in its contributions to the hi-tech economy. Israel has become the world&#39;s paramount example of the blessings of freedom. Hatred of Israel, like anti-Semitism through history, arises from resentment of Jewish success. Rooted in a Marxist zero-sum-game theory of economics, this vision has fueled the anti-Semitic ranting of Hitler, Arafat, bin Laden and history&#39;s other notorious haters. Faced with a contest between murderous regimes sustained by envy and Nazi ideology, and a free, prosperous, and capitalist, Israel, whose side are you on?</p><p>George Gilder's bestselling books have sold more than two million copies worldwide. In <i>Wealth and Poverty</i>, one of the most influential books of our time, Gilder made the moral case for capitalist creativity.

At the heart of the book is a quest to understand what makes a truly great photograph. What is it that makes a photograph by Nan Goldin or Henri Cartier Bresson stand out among the millions of others taken by all of us every single day? &#34;The Genius of Photography&#34; examines the evolution of photography in its wider context: social, political, economic, technological and artistic. It brings a critical perspective and a strong aesthetic sense to the subject, but above all it is primarily a narrative history. It begins with the earliest days of the photograph in the 1840s and ends with an examination of the state of photography today and the effect that the &#39;digital revolution&#39; will have, changing not only how we look at a photograph but what it is in a physical sense.This book examines all the different genres of photography from landscape and portraiture to news and reportage. It also tells the great stories behind many of the world&#39;s most iconic photographs and reveals the extraordinary characters - from Louis Daguerre and Cindy Sherman, Paul Strand and Robert Capa - who have made and defined this art form. Provocative and enlightening by turns, this is a major book for anyone who wants to know more about one of the most important art forms of the 21st century.</p><p>Gerry Badger is a photographer, architect, curator and critic.

Lottman&#39;s biography of Jules Verne dwells on the sources of the pioneering author&#39;s creative impulses, drawing a portrait of a complicated man, driven by an insatiable wanderlust that led him to uproot his staid life in Paris, to move to the hinterlands where he recreated himself as a writer of captivating stories of science fiction, a genre he virtually created. Drawing from Verne&#39;s previously unpublished correspondence, Lottman provides revealing details about Verne&#39;s life, his worries for his troubled son Michel, and the relationship with his domineering publisher and editor Pierre-Jules Hetzel, all of which provides new insight into Verne and his written work. Perhaps most fascinating is the close relationship between the success of Verne&#39;s work and the innovative marketing of his novels by Hetzel, showing that Verne was not only creating new genres, but also blazing trails as a literary media star.An unsurprising biography of one of the founding fathers of science fiction, by a specialist in French literature and culture. Lottman (The French Rothschilds, 1995, etc.) points out that the ostensibly definitive biography of Verne was written by one of Verne's relatives, Marguerite Allotte, who polished up his image with a free hand. So the reader is primed for new revelations and insights; alas, there are few if any here. Born in 1828 in the shipbuilding city of Nantes, Verne received a strict Catholic education in his youth, and was sent to Paris to study law--his father's profession. But he fell in with a Parisian literary crowd, including Alexandre Dumas, and was soon trying his hand at the sort of ephemeral comedy favored by the boulevard crowd. A popular science magazine, looking for a way to dramatize the latest discoveries, took several of his fictionalized accounts of travel to exotic places. But he had to support himself as a stockbroker until he broke into popular acclaim with Five Weeks in a Balloon--a fictional journey over the then unknown interior of Africa. While the novel shows the impact of Defoe, Fenimore Cooper, and Poe on the 33-year-old Verne, in many ways it was a clear preview of what he would do in almost all his work to come. Verne was soon writing two to three books a year, almost all tracing dramatic journeys to exotic or even imaginary places; while Lottman dutifully summarizes the plot of each, he finds little of interest to say about them beyond tracing obvious influences. In 1871, Verne moved from Paris to rural Amiens, where, despite his growing fame, he lived an increasingly hermetic life until his death early in 1905. Lottman does his best to inject a bit of drama into his subject's rather quiet life, examining every small incident he can unearth, but in the end there is little here to keep even the most dedicated Verne fan awake. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Each volume in this series reprints two full years of Sunday strips, or 104 full-page, black-and-white Sunday strips (Herriman did not incorporate color into the strip until 1935). Krazy Kat is a love story, focusing on the relationship of its three main characters. Krazy Kat adored Ignatz Mouse. Ignatz Mouse hated Krazy Kat, the expression of which was in throwing bricks at Krazy's head. Offisa Pup loved Krazy and sought to protect "her" (Herriman always maintained that Krazy was genderless), mostly by throwing Ignatz in jail. Each of the characters was ignorant of the other's true motivations. This simple structure allowed Herriman to build entire worlds of meaning into the actions, building thematic depth that led critics like Gilbert Seldes and E. E. Cummings to recognize Herriman's genius almost immediately. Each of Fantagraphics' <em>Krazy &amp; Ignatz</em> volumes is designed by Chris Ware, creator of the wildly successful <em>ACME Novelty Library</em> series.

She lives with her daughter in Melbourne, Australia.Chapter 1 I&#x2019;ve come to accept the fact that I&#x2019;m a guardian. I&#x2019;ll even admit that I enjoy hunting down those rogue supernatural elements who prey on humans and nonhumans alike.<br><br>But that doesn&#x2019;t mean there still aren&#x2019;t times when I absolutely hate my job.<br><br>Getting a call-out at three a.m. on a bitterly cold winter night was definitely one of those times. Especially when the call sent me to an area rapidly gaining a reputation as the &#x201c;it&#x201d; spot for blood whores&#x2014;which was the common term for humans hooked on the pleasures of a vampire&#x2019;s bite.<br><br>Normally I didn&#x2019;t have a problem with people getting their kicks any damn way they pleased, but for humans&#x2014;and it only seemed to afflict humans, not the rest of us&#x2014;becoming addicted to a vampire&#x2019;s bite was definitely one of the quicker ways to court death. They simply didn&#x2019;t have the strength, the speed, or even the willpower to battle a vampire if things went wrong. Hell, many supernaturals didn&#x2019;t, either.<br><br>And while most vampires were generally law- abiding and took only enough to give the addicted his or her hit, there were always some abusers who pushed for longer, stronger rushes, and there were always vampires willing to oblige.<br><br>And sometimes that meant death.<br><br>It had become such a problem in recent months that the government had set up a think tank to find ways of curtailing the growing numbers flocking to the vampire bars. There were even calls to outlaw the practice&#x2014;though how the hell anyone was going to police that, I had no idea. It wasn&#x2019;t like ordinary cops had much hope of tracking down and arresting vamps, and there simply weren&#x2019;t enough of us guardians. Not if they wanted us to do our real job.<br><br>Personally, I think they had about as much hope of stopping this craze as they did stopping all the designer drugs that were constantly hitting the streets. If a junkie wanted his fix, then he&#x2019;d find it no matter how difficult or how illegal the government made it. And at least all the whores were of legal age&#x2014;the vampire &#x201c;pushers&#x201d; were careful about that. They had to be, because otherwise they had to deal with the Directorate. Regular drug dealers just got jail time, at worst.<br><br>Of course, there was no proof that the murder I&#x2019;d been called to tonight was yet another pleasure seeker who&#x2019;d pushed too far. Jack had simply told me to get my butt over there pronto, and the edge in his voice had me scrambling for clothes and not taking the time for questions. But the murder had happened in the older section of Fitzroy, in a parking lot behind Dante&#x2019;s&#x2014;and that club was a prime location for blood whores and their vampire johns.<br><br>I slowed the car as I passed through the Smith Street intersection, then turned left onto Budd Street. Several of the streetlights were out, and darkness closed in around the car. The buildings here were mainly old factories and warehouses, their brick walls grimy and covered with graffiti. The few houses squeezed in between the larger buildings were dark&#x2014;and with the graffiti on their walls and the filth littering their front fences, it was hard to tell whether they were occupied or not. But I was a dhampire&#x2014;part werewolf, part vampire&#x2014;and had inherited many gifts from both parts of my heritage. The vampire part of my soul could see the blood heat within those buildings&#x2014; although unlike my twin brother, I couldn&#x2019;t hear the siren call of their heartbeats.<br><br>And I was damn glad of that, because it meant I&#x2019;d also missed out on the vampire&#x2019;s hunger for blood. Rhoan hadn&#x2019;t, but he had missed the fangs, and his blood hunger rose in tandem only with the full moon.<br><br>The crime scene came into view and I pulled up behind a Directorate van. The wind&#x2019;s icy fingers slapped across the back of my neck as I climbed out, and I hastily zipped up my jacket then pulled up the collar. It didn&#x2019;t help much. I might be a werewolf, and therefore supposedly immune to the winter, but the cold and I had never been on friendly terms.<br><br>I shoved my hands into my pockets and walked toward the parking lot. The rotating blue lights of the squad cars washed the night and the few bystanders in a ghostly glow, but as far as I could see or feel, there were no actual ghosts in the area. And if this was just a feeding taken too far, then there probably wouldn&#x2019;t be. As far as I knew, the souls that hung around tended to be the ones who&#x2019;d met a violent end or who had something they needed to finish before they moved on. And blood whores didn&#x2019;t fit either of those categories, because they&#x2019;d gone to their deaths knowing the dangers and not caring one bit.<br><br>And that&#x2019;s probably what annoyed me most. These people were knowingly flirting with death, yet when he answered, everyone got righteously moral and wanted the vamp responsible caught and killed. And the guardians were obliged to obey, because that was the law. But killing a blood whore wasn&#x2019;t a simple act of murder. It was consensual, and that raised a whole different set of issues. And although I did believe the vamp involved needed to be punished, killing him seemed a step too far. Most of the vampire community agreed.<br><br>Meaning that the worst part of the whole situation was the fact that our pursuit of these vamps was raising a lot of bad feeling in the supernatural community. And having the city&#x2019;s vampires angry at us could only ever end badly. There were a whole lot more of them than us, and as well trained as we guardians were, we didn&#x2019;t have a hope if the vamps decided we were too much of a problem.<br><br>Of course, the two vampires who dominated my life&#x2014;Quinn, my lover, and Jack, my boss&#x2014;thought I was making too much of the situation. Jack even kept trying to reassure me with the fact that the vampire council had a handle on it. I didn&#x2019;t believe it&#x2014;or them. They weren&#x2019;t out on the street dealing with the ill feeling day in and day out. They simply didn&#x2019;t understand how bad it was getting.<br><br>I did, and I didn&#x2019;t mind admitting that it scared me.<br><br>The parking lot had several cars in it. The mobile light towers weren&#x2019;t trained on any of them, but rather on the corner of the lot, where it intersected with Dante&#x2019;s back wall. There were several overall-clad men there, and relief slithered through me as I caught the glint of silver hair. Cole might be our top guy when it came to crime scene forensics, but he also hated these early-morning call-outs as much as I did. That meant he&#x2019;d be doing his best to find the clues and get the hell home as quickly as possible.<br><br>As I ducked under the blue and white police tape lining the parking lot, one of the cops keeping an eye on the small crowd huddled in the middle of the road took a step in my direction. I grabbed my badge and flashed it his way, shivering a little as the wind hit my fingers and chilled them in an instant.<br><br>The cop gave me a nod and turned back. I stepped over the gnarled roots of a small tree struggling to survive in a little corner of bare ground then flared my nostrils, drawing in the flavors of the night.<br><br>Blood was the strongest scent, and that surprised me. Most vampires hated wasting their food, so maybe this murder wasn&#x2019;t as straightforward as I&#x2019;d been presuming.<br><br>Cole looked up as I approached, his lined face weary and dark shadows under his normally bright blue eyes. &#x201c;You took your time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And you look like shit.&#x201d; I stopped beside him and stared down at the victim.<br><br>He was male, probably in his mid to late forties if his worn features and gray-flecked hair were anything to go by. There were no obvious wounds on his body, and very little in the way of blood on the front of his clothes. His arms had been crossed over his chest, almost as if he were asleep rather than dead. But someone had separated his head from his neck, and even a vampire couldn&#x2019;t survive that.<br><br>The blood that was missing from his clothes formed a lake around the area where his head should have been.<br><br>&#x201c;Have you bothered looking in the mirror lately?&#x201d; Cole snapped off his bloody gloves and tossed them into a nearby contamination bin.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m trying to avoid them. Between working day shifts and getting call-outs at night, the bags under my eyes feel large enough to pack a lunch in. Who&#x2019;s our victim?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Grant Haven, a local vampire who owned a cafï¿½ up on Smith Street.&#x201d; Cole handed me a pair of slip-on shoe protectors. &#x201c;Apparently he finished locking up at one and was heading to Dante&#x2019;s for a little top-up feeding.&#x201d;</p><h2>I Love You: A Rebus Poem</h2><p>The author of the I Spy series offers preschoolers a gently illustrated poetic tale with simple text, pictures to decode, and a loving message to share.

A brilliant 18th-century Irish philosopher and statesman, Burke was a fierce champion of human rights and the Anglo-American constitutional tradition, and a lifelong campaigner against arbitrary power. Revered by great Americans including Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, Burke has been almost forgotten in recent years. But as politician and political philosopher Jesse Norman argues in this penetrating biography, we cannot understand modern politics without him.<br><br>As Norman reveals, Burke was often ahead of his time, anticipating the abolition of slavery and arguing for free markets, equality for Catholics in Ireland, and responsible government in India, among many other things. He was not always popular in his own lifetime, but his ideas about power, community, and civic virtue have endured long past his death. Indeed, Burke engaged with many of the same issues politicians face today, including the rise of ideological extremism, the loss of social cohesion, the dangers of the corporate state, and the effects of revolution on societies. He offers us now a compelling critique of liberal individualism, and a vision of society based not on a self-interested agreement among individuals, but rather on an enduring covenant between generations.<br><br>Burke won admirers in the American colonies for recognizing their fierce spirit of liberty and for speaking out against British oppression, but his greatest triumph was seeing through the utopian aura of the French Revolution. In repudiating that revolution, Burke laid the basis for much of the robust conservative ideology that remains with us to this day: one that is adaptable and forward-thinking, but also mindful of the debt we owe to past generations and our duty to preserve and uphold the institutions we have inherited. He is the first conservative.<br><br>A rich, accessible, and provocative biography, <i>Edmund Burke</i> describes Burke&#x2019;s life and achievements alongside his momentous legacy, showing how Burke&#x2019;s analytical mind and deep capacity for empathy made him such a vital thinkerboth for his own age, and for ours.<br></p><p>Jesse Norman is widely regarded as one of the rising stars of the British House of Commons. As Member of Parliament for Hereford and South Herefordshire, he was given the prestigious Parliamentarian of the Year award in 2012. Educated at Oxford University (BA) and University College London (MPhil, PhD), he has taught philosophy at University College London, and is the author of several books and political works, including<i>Compassionate Conservatism</i>. He lives in Hereford and London.<br>Daniel Hannan, "Wall Street Journal"<br> You won t find a more impressive political philosopher than the 18th-century MP who more or less invented Anglosphere conservatism. And you won t find a pithier, more readable treatise on his life and works than this one. I reckon any open-minded reader will finish the book as a conservative. <br>"Financial Times"<br> [A] superb new biography. Norman aims to place Burke above Hume, Smith, Mill, Marx and Rawls in the pantheon. Not only that, he seeks to reclaim Burke as a conservative thinker one who has much to teach today s politicians. Implicitly, this also requires Norman to answer the question, what is conservatism? For if Burke is the father of conservatism, as Norman attests, then his children seem like runaways.... Norman succeeds in elevating his subject, showing what is conservative about Burke, and why he matters today. Ironically, he makes such a strong case that it would seem perverse if only Tories took something from Burke s legacy. Burke may be a conservative but, as he would have explained better than anyone, his is an inheritance for all of society. <br>"Sunday Business Post," UK<br> A Conservative MP himself, Norman has been tipped as a future prime minister but this stimulating book suggests that he may well have an alternative career as a writer instead. <br>"History New Network"<br> Norman s book is far better as history than it is as contemporary prescription. And that is what it s meant to be. It provides a wonderful (re)introduction to the life and thought of an often neglected political thinker. Norman writes exceptionally well. His prose flows, he has an eye for the apposite anecdote, and he handles abstract arguments smoothly and precisely. If the political gig doesn t work out, this book shows that he has a future as a historian. <br>"The Economist"<br> [A] succinct history of Edmund Burke s life and thought." <br>E. J. Dionne, "Washington Post"<br> Norman s Burke biography ought to be one of the hot books for the right over the next year. Like Burke (1729-1797), Norman is a philosopher as well as a politician. He offers a brisk and engaging introduction to the iconic thinker s life and thought. <br>Clive Crook, "Bloomberg View"<br> [A] fine new biography.... Burke has a lot to teach us. Norman s splendid book is a good place to start. <br>"American Spectator"<br> [A] superb new biography.... Norman makes a strong case for Burke s continuing relevance.... Norman succeeds in bringing Burke to life and championing his thought. The greatest of Irishmen has much to teach both liberals and conservatives, and a politics guided by his spirit would ennoble us all. <br>"Wall Street Journal"<br>"Well written and informative. In this history one discovers Burke s continuing importance, even if our age of hyper-individualism and headlong social experimentation seems ill-suited to his genius. <br>"National Review"<br> An engaging, highly readable, and impressively comprehensive overview. It handles the intricacies of English history and politics with great mastery and conveys Burke s character and personality as few of his biographers have managed to do.... In the biographical first section...Norman finds just the right balance between fast-paced storytelling and gripping historical detail, and he shines a light both on Burke s great strengths as a thinker, writer, and orator and on his great weaknesses. <br>"Los Angeles Times Review of Books"<br> Norman has the knack for presenting in clear and cogent terms notions taken from political theory, philosophy, and the social sciences.... The call for political prudence, the emphasis on provisional solutions, and the reminder that change, while it must be moderated, is necessary: our era s conservative activists are trampling these Burkean conservative ideals. At the very least, Jesse Norman s account of Edmund Burke s thought leads us to our own reflections on the current revolution in America. <br>Michael Gerson, "Washington Post"<br> Conservatives would be well advised to listen to a Whig. <br>David Frum, "CNN.com"<br> A distinguished book.... As Norman tells it, Burke was a thinker and politician who rejected the demands of I want in favor of the duties of you should. ... Here is a conservative who has much to say in the era of predatory finance and selective bailouts. A politician himself, Norman shrewdly appreciates that Burke s contributions emerged from an active career. Burke understood the limits of the possible because he himself had often bumped up against them hard. <br>"Commentary"<br> [An] outstanding biography. <br>"Telegraph"<br> Norman himself is a practicing, indeed a rising, politician, and so he is clear-sighted about Burke s practical failures. But he is also a subtle historian of ideas. He does an excellent job of extracting from his subject s speeches and writings why, in his view, Burke is the first and most important conservative thinker. <br>"New Criterion"<br> Not since Cicero had a major political thinker been a practicing politician in the center of the arena. So it is refreshingly welcome to have Burke reassessed today by another politician.... Norman boldly summarizes Burke s thought for our time. <br>Matthew D'Ancona, "Sunday Telegraph"<br>"A must-read for anyone interested in politics and history.... Superb." <br>"Evening Standard" (London)<br> [A] scintillating book.... Norman s erudition and rebellious streak...has led to chatter about his potential as a Tory leader. He has something of Polonius about him. Just as with an earlier pamphlet called "The Big Society," he has now, under the guise of history, articulated much of what our government stands for. <br>"Washington Times"<br>"[A] lucid and thrilling exposition of [Burke s] political philosophy.... The second part of the book is pure brilliance, a refreshingly candid and discursive examination of Burke s philosophy, and how the West might be wise to readopt it.... There are many, many original and excellent thoughts about Burke in this volume, too many to be discussed here.... Any amateur or professional student of political philosophy should take Mr. Norman s book seriously. <br>AC Grayling, "Prospect"<br> [A] lively new biography.... [An] affectionate account of the life and thought of one of Norman s heroes.... Norman s biography is an engaging attempt to show how the intellectual debates of the 18th century can be deployed in today s politics. <br>"Scotland on Sunday"<br> [A] fluent and precise book. <br>"Sunday Business Post"<br> This is a book about 18th century politics with a 21st century context.... [A] heartfelt tribute to the great Anglo-Irish statesman Edmund Burke.... [An] impressive book. <br>"Pittsburgh Tribune Review"<br> Contending that understanding Burke is necessary to understand politics today, this book is both a reminder of his importance and a refresher course on his outlook, bringing to the fore principles as relevant now as they were when Burke formulated them. <br>"Kirkus Reviews," Starred Review<br> [Norman] provides a fascinating picture of the political scene in England in the 18th century. A top-notch introduction to Burke and his paternity of political systems throughout the Western Hemisphere. Even better, the author points out where ignoring Burke s thoughts have caused unnecessary difficulties. <br>"Library Journal"<br> Norman, himself a Conservative member of Parliament, first presents Burke s life, then examines the man s philosophy. The results serve as a solid, workmanlike introduction to the reformer and his time. The philosophical half of the book is clear, free of jargon, and accessible, painting Burke as a realist.... A sound introduction to a thinker who remains important two centuries after his death. Very lightly footnoted and with a select bibliography, this will be a starting point for readers new to the study of Burke s life and ideas. <br>Harvey Mansfield, William R. Kenan, Jr. Professor of Government, Harvard University<br> An excellent book, which unites biographical and political insights. The best short biography of Burke for nearly 50 years, and a pleasure to read. <br>Boris Johnson, Mayor of London<br> Jesse Norman has brought back Burke in triumphand not before time. Are you fed up with the selfish individualism of our age? Are you sickened by the shallow cult of money and celebrity? It is time you had a new look at Burke, the 18th century giant who first understood that we are all in this together; that human beings are social animals, tied to institutions by love and instinct, and that those institutions are themselves a source of strength and comfort and a hidden wisdom that we ignore at our peril. This is an overdue reassessment of a politician who was not only one of the greatest orators of any epoch, but the father of the modern political party, a man who campaigned with equal brio and genius against British exploitation of India and the bloody tyranny of the French revolution. Anyone who cares about politics will pounce on this book and devour it, as I did, in a sitting. A stunning performance. <br>"</p><h2>Conan and the Spider God</h2><p>Fleeing the Priest of Erlik&#39;s revenge, Conan escapes to Sultanapur only to be accused of abducting the King&#39;s favorite wife, Jamilah.

The last great sea action of the period, it established British naval supremacy and ended the threat of French invasion. <i>The Trafalgar Companion</i> not only chronicles the campaign and the battle itself in unprecedented detail, but it also charts Admiral Lord Nelson&#x2019;s life and career as well as his death at the height of the battle. Providing a wealth of background details on contemporary naval life, seamanship, gunnery, tactics, and much else, the narrative is supplemented by informative sidebars, 200 color illustrations, and stage-by-stage battle diagrams.</p><p>Mark Adkin, a former army officer, is the author of The Waterloo Companion, The Trafalgar Companion and The Gettysburg Companion, all published by Aurum. He has also authored several other books on military history, including Goose Green, The Bear Trap and The Charge. He has also written the bestselling Sharpe Companion to accompany the TV series.On October 21, 1805, a British fleet led by Admiral Lord Nelson effectively crippled the combined fleets of Spain and France off of Spain's Cape Trafalgar&#x2014;crushing Napoleon Bonaparte's dream of invading and conquering Britain. Despite suffering a mortal wound during the battle, Nelson secured his place in history with this victory, as well as ensuring Britain's century-long naval dominance of the Continent. Adkin, a former British army officer and the author of a comparable volume on Napoleon's last campaign, <i>The Waterloo Companion</i>, has compiled a fitting tribute to the historic action. This heavily illustrated encyclopedic volume is packed with "facts, figures, analyses [and] recollections" relating to the battle and Nelson's career. As such, it is two books in one&#x2014;battle history and Nelson biography. There are sections detailing every conceivable aspect of nautical life in the 19th century&#x2014;ships and seamanship, guns and tactics, command and control, et al.&#x2014;and sidebars sprinkled throughout the narrative present anecdotes, vignettes and little-known facts. In addition to its encyclopedic coverage, the book is a visual feast with hundreds of detailed maps and diagrams and exquisite drawings. The two-page, colored drawings of many of the ships of both fleets&#x2014;including Nelson's flagship, <i>Victory</i>&#x2014;are stunning in their detail. Handsome and authoritative, this volume will give fans of naval history and warfare many hours of browsing pleasure. <i>(Oct. 15)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Until recently, the scientific community&#x2014;and most notably, those from the National Institute for Health&#x2014;have been unwilling to look at his provocative theories of different causes for cancer and HIV/AIDS.

By the end of the day, his wife Christine had been savagely bludgeoned to death in the couple&#x2019;s bed&#x2014;and the Williamson County Sherriff&#x2019;s office in Texas wasted no time in pinning her murder on Michael, despite an absolute lack of physical evidence.

He spent almost twenty-five years in prison before being exonerated through the efforts of the Innocence Project, pro bono lawyer John Raley, and advances in DNA technology.

He believed his father was the murderer who&#x2019;d killed the person he loved most.<br> <br>And why wouldn&#x2019;t he? That&#x2019;s what everyone told him. On each of the rare occasions Eric saw me, my imprisonment&#x2014;my inmate uniform, the guards and the guns, the bars and the buzzers&#x2014;was a stark reminder that the world had decided I wasn&#x2019;t fit to walk free.<br> <br>Ironically, Eric was one of the two people who knew what had really happened.

When Nore begins to suspect that a track photographer's fatal accident was really murder, he sets out to discover the truth and to trap the killer. Slowly, he unravels some nasty secrets of corruption, blackmail and murder--and unwittingly sets himself up as the killer's next target.<br>"A burst with action."<br>THE LOST ANGELES TIMES</p><p>Dick Francis was one of the most successful post-war National Hunt jockeys. The winner of over 350 races, he was champion jockey in 1953/1954 and rode for HM Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, most famously on Devon Loch in the 1956 Grand National. On his retirement from the saddle, he published his autobiography, The Sport of Queens, before going on to write forty-three bestselling novels, a volume of short stories (Field of 13), and the biography of Lester Piggott. During his lifetime Dick Francis received many awards, amongst them the prestigious Crime Writers&#39; Association&#39;s Cartier Diamond Dagger for his outstanding contribution to the genre, and three &#39;best novel&#39; Edgar Allan Poe awards from The Mystery Writers of America. In 1996 he was named by them as Grand Master for a lifetime&#39;s achievement. In 1998 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, and was awarded a CBE in the Queen&#39;s Birthday Honours List of 2000. Dick Francis died in February 2010, at the age of eighty-nine, but he remains one of the greatest thriller writers of all time.Philip Nore is a jockey whose life is turned upside down by secrets, deadly secrets left by a racetrack photographer who dies in a car crash and family secrets known only to a much-hated grandmother. Dick Francis is always a good read, and the narrator, Tony Britton, heightens the enjoyment tremendously. He has a warm, richly layered voice that is relaxing and never hits a wrong note. From the harsh, deriding voice of Philip's grandmother, to the light, waffling voice of Jeremy Folk, a young solicitor, Britton gets everything right, giving each character a distinct and consistent voice. Definitely a value-added listening experience.

Ogedai's heart was full as he guided his horse down the main thoroughfare, taking in every sight and sound around him. There was a sense of urgency in the cacophony of hammer blows and shouted orders. The Mongol tumans had gathered outside the city. His generals, his people, had been summoned there to see what two years of labor had created: a city in a wilderness, with the Orkhon River tamed and bent to his will.<br><br>Ogedai reined in for a moment to watch a group of workmen unload a cart. Nervous under his gaze, the laborers used ropes, pulleys, and sheer numbers to maneuver blocks of white marble onto low sledges that could be dragged into the workshops. Each milky block was subtly veined in a light blue that pleased Ogedai. He owned the quarry that had birthed the stones, hundreds of miles to the east, just one of a thousand purchases he had made in the last years.<br><br>There was no doubt he had been extravagant, spending gold and silver as if it had no value. He smiled at the thought, wondering what his father would have made of the white city rising in the wilderness. Genghis had despised the anthills of humanity, but these were not the ancient stones and teeming streets of an enemy. This was new and it belonged to the nation.<br><br>There had never been a treasury like the one he had inherited, amassed from the wealth of China and Khwarezm, yet never spent by its khan. With the tribute from Yenking alone, Ogedai could have sheathed every new home in white marble or even jade if he had wanted. He had built a monument to his father on the plains, as well as a place where he himself could be khan. He had built a palace with a tower that rose above the city like a white sword, so that all men could see the nation had come far from simple gers and herds.<br><br>For his gold, a million men had come to work. They had crossed plains and deserts with just a few animals and tools, coming from as far off as Chin lands or the cities of Samarkand, Bukhara, and Kabul. Masons and carpenters from Koryo had made the journey, called to the west by rumors of a new city being built on a river of coins. Bulgars brought stocks of rare clays, charcoal, and hardwood in great caravans from their forests. The city filled with traders, builders, potters, foodsellers, thieves, and scoundrels. Farmers scenting a profit brought their carts for days of travel, all for the strings of metal coins. Ogedai gave them gold and silver from the earth, melted and shaped. In return they gave him a city, and he did not find it a bad bargain. For the present, they were the colorful crowds of his city, speaking a hundred tongues and cooking a thousand different foods and spices. Some of them would be allowed to stay, but he was not building it for them.<br><br>Ogedai saw green-handed dyers flatten themselves against the walls, their red turbans dipping in respect. His Guards cleared the way ahead, so the son of Genghis could ride almost in a dream. He had made this place from the camp of gers his father had known. He had made it real, in stone.<br><br>It still amazed him. He had not paid for women to travel with his workers, but they had come with their husbands and fathers. He had wondered for a time how he would establish the businesses every city needed to thrive, but traders had approached his chancellor, offering horses or more silver to lease new properties. The city was more than a simple collection of houses. Already it had a vitality of its own, far beyond his control.<br><br>Yet not completely. A quirk in the plans had created an area of small alleyways in the south of his city. Criminal gangs had begun to flourish there until Ogedai heard. He had ordered eight hundred buildings torn down, the whole area redesigned and rebuilt. His own Guard had supervised the hangings.<br><br>The street fell quiet as he passed, the laborers and their masters bowing their heads as they saw the man who held the power of life and death and gold over all of them. Ogedai took a deep breath of the dusty air, enjoying the taste of it on his tongue and the thought that he was literally breathing in his creation. Ahead, he could see the towers of his palace, crowned in a dome of gold beaten thinner than the paper of his scribes. It raised his spirits to see it, like sunlight trapped and held in his city.<br><br>The street widened as it grew before him, its stone gutters polished. That section had been finished months before and the bustling crowds of laborers fell behind. As Ogedai trotted on, he could not help glancing at the boundary walls that had so confused his Chin architects and laborers. Even from the low vantage point of a saddle, there were moments when he could see over them to the green plains beyond. The walls of Yenking had not saved that city from fire or siege, he knew. His walls were the warriors of the khan, the tribes who had brought a Chin emperor to his knees and razed a shah's cities.<br><br>Already, Ogedai loved his creation, from the vast expanse of the central training ground, to the red-tiled roofs, the paved gutters, the temples and churches and mosques and markets and homes by the thousand, most still empty and waiting for life. Scraps of blue cloth fluttered in the plains wind on every corner, a tribute to the sky father above them all. In the south, green foothills and mountains stretched far away and the air was warm with dust as Ogedai rejoiced in Karakorum.<br><br>The twilight was deepening into a soft gloom as Ogedai handed his reins to a servant and strode up the steps to his palace. Before he entered, he looked back once more at the city straining to be born. He could smell fresh-turned earth and, over it, the fried food of the workmen on the evening air. He had not planned the herds of livestock in corrals beyond the walls, or the squawking chickens sold on every corner. He thought of the wool market that had sprung up by the western gate. He should not have expected trade to halt simply because the city was unfinished. He had chosen a spot on an ancient traders' road to give it life--and life had begun pouring in while whole streets, whole districts, were still piles of lumber, tile, and stone.<br><br>As he looked into the setting sun, he smiled at the cooking fires on the plains surrounding the city. His people waited there, for him. His armies would be fed on rich mutton, dripping fat from the summer grass. It reminded him of his own hunger, and he moistened his lips as he passed through a stone gate the equal of anything in a Chin city.<br><br>In the echoing hall beyond, he paused for a moment at his most extravagant gesture. A tree of solid silver stretched gracefully up to the arched ceiling, where the center point was open to the sky like the ger of any herdsman. It had taken the silversmiths of Samarkand almost a year to cast and polish, but it served his purpose. Whoever entered his palace would see it and be staggered at the wealth it represented. Some would see an emblem for the silver people, the Mongol tribes who had become a nation. Those with more wisdom would see that the Mongols cared so little for silver that they used it as a casting metal.<br><br>Ogedai let his hand slide down the bole of the tree, feeling the metal chill his fingers. The spreading branches reached out in a parody of life, gleaming like a white birch in moonlight. Ogedai nodded to himself. He stretched his back as lamps were lit by slaves and servants all around him, throwing black shadows and making the evening seem suddenly darker outside.<br><br>He heard hurrying footsteps and saw his manservant, Baras'aghur, approaching. Ogedai winced at the man's keen expression and the bundle of papers under his arm.<br><br>"After I have eaten, Baras. It has been a long day."<br><br>"Very well, my lord, but you have a visitor: your uncle. Shall I tell him to wait on your pleasure?"<br><br>Ogedai paused in the act of unbuckling his sword belt. All three of his uncles had come to the plains around Karakorum at his order, gathering their tumans in great camps. He had forbidden them all from entering the city, and he wondered who would have disobeyed him. He suspected it would be Khasar, who regarded orders and laws as tools for other men rather than himself.<br><br>"Who is it, Baras?" Ogedai asked quietly.<br><br>"Lord Temuge, master. I have sent servants to tend him, but he has been waiting now for a long time."<br><br>Baras'aghur made a gesture to indicate a sweep of the sun in the sky, and Ogedai pursed his lips in irritation. His father's brother would be well aware of the nuances of hospitality. Simply by arriving when Ogedai was not there to greet him, he had created an obligation. Ogedai assumed it was deliberate. A man like Temuge was too subtle not to grasp the slightest advantage. Yet the order had gone out for the generals and princes to remain on the plains.<br><br>Ogedai sighed. For two years, he had readied Karakorum to be the jewel in an empire. His had been a splendid isolation and he had maneuvered to keep it so, his enemies and friends always off balance. He had known it could not last forever. He steeled himself as he walked after Baras'aghur to the first and most sumptuous of his audience rooms.<br><br>"Have wine brought to me immediately, Baras. And food--something simple, such as the warriors are eating on the plain."<br><br>"Your will, my lord," his servant said without listening, his thoughts on the meeting to come.<br><br>The footsteps of the two men were loud in the silent halls, clicking and echoing back to them. Ogedai did not glance at the painted scenes that usually gave him so much pleasure. He and Baras'aghur walked under the best work of Islamic artists, and it was only toward the end that Ogedai looked up at a blaze of color, smiling to himself at the image of Genghis leading a charge at the Badger's Mouth pass. The artist had asked a fortune for a year's work, but Ogedai had doubled his price when he saw it. His father still lived on those walls, as well as in his memory. There was no art of painting in the tribes he knew, and such things could still make him g...</p><h2>Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold</h2><p><b>"The very model of the modern paranoid novel" (<i>New York Times</i>) and an ambitious work of semi-autobiographical fiction from one of England's greatest novelists. </b><br><br>Gilbert Pinfold is a reclusive Catholic novelist suffering from acute inertia.

Groves, the Man behind the Birth of the Atomic Age</h2><p>In September 1942, Colonel Leslie R. Groves was given the job of building the atomic bomb. As a career officer in the Army Corps of Engineers, Groves had overseen hundreds of military construction projects, including the Pentagon. Until now, scientists have received the credit for the Manhattan Project&#x2019;s remarkable achievements. And yet, it was Leslie R. Groves who made things happen. It was Groves who drove manufacturers, construction crews, scientists, industrialists, and military and civilian officials to come up with the money, the materials, and the plans to solve thousands of problems and build the bomb in only two years. It was his operation, and in <i>Racing for the Bomb</i> he emerges as a take-charge, can-do figure who succeeds in the face of formidable odds.<br><br>Revealed for the first time in <i>Racing for the Bomb</i>, Groves played a crucial and decisive role in the planning, timing, and targeting of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki missions.

Here Sandra Zimdars-Swartz provides a detective-like investigation of the experiences and interpretations of six major apparitions, including those at La Salette and Lourdes in France during the mid-nineteenth century; at Fatima, Portugal, in 1917; and the more recent ones at San Damiano, Italy; Garabandal, Spain; and Medjugorje, Yugoslavia, where the apparitions continue. Adopting a phenomenological approach to these "encounters with Mary"--one that is neither apologetic nor antagonistic--the author explores the tension between the personal meaning of the events for their subjects and the public appropriation of this meaning by a larger religious community. Along the way she examines the backgrounds of the seers, their willingness or reluctance to talk about the apparitions and their messages, the amount of emotional support they received from family and community as news of the apparitions spread, the reports of miracles at apparition sites, the reactions of local authorities, and the steps taken by the Roman Catholic Church in officially recognizing or rejecting the apparitions as worthy of belief. The author concludes with a survey of religious worldviews based on Marian apparitions, focusing especially on the now-popular transcultural apocalyptic nature of these messages to the modern world.</p><p>Originally published in 1991.</p><p>The <b>Princeton Legacy Library</b> uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

Reprint.</p><p>"Who cares what straight people think about us?" complains one of the characters in Andrew Holleran's first collection of short stories. "I don't care if they understand what I do in bed. <i>I</i> don't even understand what I do in bed, I could care less what <i>they</i> think about it." And just as many of the gay men in these 16 stories (only three of which have been previously published) refuse--or simply feel no need--to explain themselves, so too does Holleran explore his characters' lives with no effort to justify them. His witty, urbane characters who vacation in Key West or Fire Island are not the only types of gay men, of course, just those Holleran has chosen to write about. He writes on his own terms, and his characters--even when they are struggling to navigate through desire or loss--live on their own terms, not as stereotypes but as people with complex emotional lives.<p> Holleran's stories are crafted with such polished prose--slyly humorous and achingly poignant in turn--that one is immediately struck by their beauty. Every story seems to have its share of brilliant dialogue or descriptive passages, like the storyteller in "The Hamburger Man" who "didn't have the very best gossip--but ... belonged to that class of people who know one or two people who do." And in the final story, which gives the book its title, Holleran shows that he's equally adept at capturing the fleeting beauty of nature, in a setting "annealed by a delicate silver light, the most beautiful light of the whole year, a light that was both warm (if one lay in the sun, as he did now) and cool (if one stood in the shade)."</p>Andrew Holleran is the author of <i>Dancer from the Dance</i>, <i>Nights in Aruba</i>, <i>The Beauty of Men</i>, and a collection of essays, <i>Ground Zero</i>.</p><h2>Winter Dreams, Christmas Love (Point)</h2><p>Ellen Marlowe, a high-school freshman, worries that her budding romance with dashing senior Michael Tyler will not survive when he goes off to college in the fall. Original.</p><p>This lengthy tale of obsessive love begins when Ellen, 14, meets Michael, a popular high-school junior. Responding to the young man's immediate and intense effect on her, Ellen soon realizes she's in love. Michael's friendly overtures have Ellen believing he returns her affections, but she feels otherwise when he constantly comments on their age difference. A sensible girl, she tries desperately to forget him with a busy schedule and other relationships, but for two years Michael's hold on her continues. Shura ( The Sunday Doll ; Don't Call Me Toad ) conveys unerringly the hurt and befuddlement engendered by a passive romance. Yet the largely internal story grows repetitive, and some sentences are either ungrammatical ("She acted hateful") or badly cast ("The girl wasn't anything like as pretty as Val"). Ellen's suffering may, however, strike a responsive chord with readers; in any case they will certainly sympathize with her experience.

He was the author of several works in which he expounded theories of national traits, racial superiority, herd behavior and crowd psychology. His work on crowd psychology became important during the first half of the twentieth century when it was used by media researchers such as Hadley Cantril and Herbert Blumer to describe the reactions of subordinate groups to media. He also contributed to controversy about the nature of matter and energy. His book The Evolution of Matter was very popular in France (having twelve editions), and though some of its ideas&#x2014;notably that all matter was inherently unstable and was constantly and slowly transforming into luminiferous ether&#x2014;were used by some physicists of the time (including Henri Poincarï¿½), his specific formulations were not given much consideration. In 1896 he reported observing a new kind of radiation, which he termed "black light" (not the same as what modern people call black light today), though it was later discovered not to exist.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>The Lord of the Rings: The Making of the Movie Trilogy</h2><p>An official guide to Peter Jackson&#39;s films provides inside information on all aspects of the trilogy from conceptual design through postproduction, in a volume complemented by cast and crew interviews.

One of the Manhattan Project's secret cities, it didn't appear on any maps until 1949, and yet at the height of World War II it was using more electricity than New York City and was home to more than 75,000 people, many of them young women recruited from small towns across the South. Their jobs were shrouded in mystery, but they were buoyed by a sense of shared purpose, close friendships--and a surplus of handsome scientists and Army men!<br> <br>But against this vibrant wartime backdrop, a darker story was unfolding. The penalty for talking about their work--even the most innocuous details--was job loss and eviction. One woman was recruited to spy on her coworkers. They all knew <i>something </i>big was happening at Oak Ridge, but few could piece together the true nature of their work until the bomb "Little Boy" was dropped over Hiroshima, Japan, and the secret was out. The shocking revelation: the residents of Oak Ridge were enriching uranium for the atomic bomb.<br> <br>Though the young women originally believed they would leave Oak Ridge after the war, many met husbands there, made lifelong friends, and still call the seventy-year-old town home. The reverberations from their work there--work they didn't fully understand at the time--are still being felt today. In <i>The Girls of Atomic City</i>, Denise Kiernan traces the astonishing story of these unsung WWII workers through interviews with dozens of surviving women and other Oak Ridge residents. Like <i>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</i>, this is history and science made fresh and vibrant--a beautifully told, deeply researched story that unfolds in a suspenseful and exciting way. <br><br>As heard on National Public Radio's Weekend Edition.<br>One of Goodreads' Most Popular Books of March 2013.<br>One of Amazon's Editors' Picks for Best Books of the Month (History)<br>One of Amazon's Editors' Picks for Best Books of the Month (Nonfiction)<br>One of Amazon's Big Spring Books (History)</p><p><p><b>A Note from Denise Kiernan, Author of <i>The Girls of Atomic City</i></b></p> <p>Most of us have grown up with the humbling power of the atomic bomb looming somewhere in our collective consciousness. We are at least familiar with the phrase "Manhattan Project," even if we know little of the history behind that World War II effort to make the world's first nuclear weapon. Los Alamos. Oppenheimer. Fermi. Groves. These names may ring a bell, if only a distant one. The story of the Manhattan Project is often discussed from the perspective of high-profile scientific minds and decision-makers.</p> <p>A black-and-white photo of young women monitoring gigantic panels covered in knobs and dials both altered my view of this story and inspired me to write <i>The Girls of Atomic City</i>. I was struck by the youth of these women, the size of the room, the unfamiliar technology. They did not know they were enriching uranium and would not know until a bomb detonated above Hiroshima. What were <i>they</i> thinking? What did the Manhattan Project look like through <i>their</i> eyes? I had my way in. I tracked down everyone I could who had worked on the Manhattan Project in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, during World War II.</p> <p>I entered a top-secret compound, one that straddled two worlds: that which existed before and that which followed the dawn of the nuclear age. Octogenarians as my trusted guides, I found not only fission and cyclotrons, but rations and dances. The satisfaction of doing one's part mixed with the anxiety of wartime. It was a world of pioneering spirit and propaganda, of scientific gains and personal loss. Loved ones were far away, deadlines and informants lurking much nearer. There was always waiting: for news, for cigarettes, for letters, for the end of the war. When that end came, it was a relief and a shock. Secrets were revealed, others still remain.</p> <p> I hope readers will be as fascinated by this moment in time as I was, as I still am.</p> Young female cubicle operators monitor the activity of the calutrons, the heart of the uranium electromagnetic separation process at the Y-12 plant. <i>Courtesy of Ed Westcott</i> <p><em>Click here for a larger image.</em></p> <em></em> Housing options included dorms and prefab homes, but also hutments and trailers, like those pictured here. <i>Courtesy of Ed Westcott</i> <p><em>Click here for a larger image.</em></p> <em> </em> Billboards and posters extolling patriotism and discretion were found throughout the United States during World War II.

Now, in this expertly packaged anthology, Caroline Kennedy and over a dozen prominent writers bring the sacrifices of those award winners to life. Some essays address famous leaders like the Good Friday peacemakers in Ireland and campaign-finance-reform stalwarts John McCain and Russell Feingold. Others hail lesser-known local officials, like school superintendent Corkin Cherubini, who braved a firestorm to end race-based tracking in Georgia. All the winners acted with a rare breed of selfless courage but sometimes this courage came at a terrible cost. U.S. Representative Carl Elliot Sr. was chased out of office in 1964 because he fought segregation in Alabama; by the time he won the first Profile in Courage Award, he was living alone in a ramshackle house, confined to a wheelchair by diabetes and hounded by creditors. Kennedy has assembled an impressive roster of writers to compose these mostly inspirational stories: Michael Beschloss, Anna Quindlen, Albert R. Hunt. The most audacious essay in the collection belongs to Bob Woodward, who reverses 25 years of conventional wisdom in arguing that former president Gerald Ford should be applauded for his pardon of Richard Nixon after Watergate. Of course, not all of the essays have the same level of distinction, but all share the same Kennedy spirit. Unabashedly liberal and pro-government, this collection is a stirring look at people who rarely thought about what they could do for themselves, but always about what they could do for their country. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Dr. Space: The Life of Wernher von Braun</h2><p>Explores the life and achievements of the rocketry pioneer who designed rockets for the Nazi war effort early in his career and later became a leading figure in the American space program.</p><p>Bob Ward, a former editor-in-chief of The Huntsville Times, has written on space subjects for decades, and covered the von Braun rocket team as a reporter. A resident of Huntsville, Alabama, he has four other books to his credit.This paean offers uncritical praise of every aspect of rocket scientist von Braun's life. While there's an enormous amount to celebrate about the man most responsible for the U.S. putting astronauts on the moon, von Braun (1912&#x2013;1977) is a more complex figure than Ward represents. As a reporter for the <i>Huntsville (Ala.) Times,</i> Ward covered von Braun during many of his years as director of the Marshall Space Flight Center, in Huntsville. In addition to his own interactions with von Braun, Ward draws too heavily on letters written by the scientist's friends and colleagues in honor of his 60th birthday. Additionally, Ward provides a relatively superficial examination of von Braun's controversial role in Nazi Germany, where he and his team of engineers created the V-2 rocket used against the Allies (this project is better presented by Michael Neufeld in <i>The Rocket and the Reich</i>). A clear picture of von Braun's enormous charisma, intellect and personality does come through, as does a sense of how critical a political (as well as technological) role von Braun played in defining America's space program. 40 b&amp;w photos. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As LaRouche himself notes: "Since the beginning of the 1984 Presidential campaign, I have been at the center of some among the leading crisis-developments affecting current history, including the Soviet and liberal establishment efforts to destroy the Strategic Defense Initiative." This book was written, in fact, when LaRouche was known most prominently around the world, as the author of what President Ronald Reagan called, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). It was LaRouche's role in convincing the Reagan administration to adopt his plan, that was largely responsible for earning him the hatred of the Anglo-American establishment, including the incoming Bush administration, that led to his unjust indictment and imprisonment which followed. <p>The chapter titles: The Making of an Economist; The Case of Norbert Wiener; The Long-Range Economic Forecast of 1959-1960; Who Is Shooting at Us, and Why?; The Secret of the Twentieth Century; I Keep an Old Promise; The SDI is born; My Marriage to Helga; The Founding of a Colony on Mars.</p></p><p>Lyndon LaRouche, a man who is today, without question, the world&#39;s leading economist, was already at the center of current history when this book was published 13 years ago. Some of the commentaries released by his collaborators around the world: &#34;The book &#39;Operation Juarez&#39; by Lyndon H. LaRouche, is the most important contribution to the understanding of the problem of development sector debt and for reaching a rational solution.&#34;From the Author's Forward:<br> During the course of the past nearly 20 years, I have become perhaps the most controversial among the influential figures of this decade. <p>Unlike all of the other leading candidates for the U.S. presidency since 1945, I am an influential original thinker.... For the past 40 years, the successful candidates for the presidency have been persons who, in the customary manner of speaking, advanced their own political career up to that point, by doing "the right thing at the right time," saying and doing nothing which will make enemies among important factions of the "establishment." </p><p>...My purpose is to present my development as I would recommend a biography of Mozart be written, or the biography of any other notable historical figure. My purpose is to show the mainspring of my behavior, to present what might otherwise be regarded as my innermost secret.</p></p><h2>A House in Bali</h2><p><b>This is a book about passion, obsession and discovery in an amazing land, but also about the voyage of a highly talented composer and writer.</b> <br><br><i>A House in Bali</i> remains one of the most remarkable books ever written about the fabled island of Bali. This classic book tells the story of Balinese culture through a history of Balinese music.<br><br>First published in 1947, it tells the story of the writer and composer Colin McPhee's (1900&#x2013;64) obsession with a music once unknown to the West, and of his journey to Bali to experience it firsthand. In 1929, the young Canadian&#x2013; born musician chanced upon rare gramophone recordings of Balinese gamelan music which were to change his life forever. From that moment, he lived for the day when he could set foot on the island where the clear, metallic music originated. He was able to realize his dreams and spent almost a decade there during the 1930's. Music of Bali and dance, as McPhee discovered to his delight, are second nature to the Balinese, and his subsequent writings and compositions proved seminal in popularizing Balinese gamelan music in the West.<br><br>In <i>A House in Bali</i>, McPhee unfolds a beguiling picture of a society long established, staggeringly poor in Western terms, but rich beyond belief in spiritual values and joy. The young composer writes about his discoveries of music in Bali and growing understanding of an astonishing culture where the arts are a prime preoccupation, and of the arts, music is supreme. Much has been written on Bali, but this classic work from 1947 remains the only narrative by a Western musician.</p><p><b>Colin McPhee</b> left Bali in 1938 as the threat of World War loomed over the Pacific.</p><h2>Follow-the-Line Quilting Designs Volume Four: Full-Size Patterns for Blocks and Borders</h2><p><p>Mary M. Covey adds to her best-selling series with this collection of all-new continuous-line motifs! Twenty pattern sets include a coordinating border, block, and setting-triangle design in each grouping. Quilting options include long-arm machines, traditional sewing machines, and quilting by hand. An instruction booklet is included.</p></p><p><p>Mary M. Covey is an award-winning quilter. Owner of a quilt-pattern company, the Good Life, Mary has quilted for more than 21 years and has spent a majority of this time sharing her talent and knowledge with others through teaching and speaking engagements. Mary's work has afforded her much acclaim, from television shows to print publications. </p>I have been eagerly anticipating the publication of a new quilting book and was very excited to see it finally available. Realize that I machine quilt my quilts on an 18" long-arm machine, so I get excited about quilting, not just quilting books. Secondly, I believe that the more quilting motifs I have available from which to choose, the better. And third, I already own all of the other books in this series and have been waiting for months for the publication of the next volume in the series.<br><br>It's Mary Covey's latest volume in her Follow-the-Line Quilting Designs series. Technically, these aren't books as much as they are separate sheets packaged in a box, but I call them books for lack of a better word. Somehow "sheets in a box" just doesn't sound right. Anyhow, volume four in this series has just been published by Martingale and Company and it promises to be as wonderful as the previous three volumes.<br><br>You may ask why I like these designs so much. Well, there are several reasons. I like the fact that these are continuous-line designs. I am a "hurry up" kind of gal and like to get things done quickly before I lose interest (yes, it does happen), so continuous-line quilting designs are my favorite motifs to work with. I don't have to stop, re-position and start quilting again.<br><br>Sometimes you may want to quilt blocks separately. If this is the case, Mary has an answer for this too. For each continuous-line design in the book, there is also a block design in various sizes. That's great, but what is even better is that she also provides corner triangles to match, so you're covered no matter where you want to quilt. Oh, did I mention that her border designs include turning the corner, so you are able to keep right on going up the side of your quilt without having to turn and match motifs? Yes, Mary has thought of everything.<br><br>Sometimes I have trouble determining where to start and how to follow a continuous-line motif. Again, Mary comes to my rescue. She includes a "start" point and has arrows and numbers for you to follow so you don't get confused stitching the patterns<br><br>Another feature that I like in this series is that each design is on its own page. The pages open up and the border motif, with the turning corner and side repeat, are there. This is easier, and more accurate, to use than trying to trace a quilting design from a book.<br><br>Best of all is Mary's choice of designs. I find her motifs easy enough for a beginner, yet interesting enough, and with enough variety, to complement any project. --chatterboxquilts.com</p><h2>Pictures by David Hockney</h2><p>Representative selection of works by the British artist with subjects executed in various media, ranging from still lifes, showers, pools, curtains, and portraits</p><p></p><h2>Ivanhoe (Oxford Pocket Classics)</h2><p>First published in 1820, today Ivanhoe has become legend and is by far the most popular of Sir Walter Scotts novels. It is the story of one of the remaining Saxon noble families at a time when the nobility in England was overwhelmingly Norman. It follows the Saxon protagonist, Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe, who is out of favour with his father for his allegiance to the Norman king Richard the Lionheart. The story is set in 1194, after the failure of the Third Crusade, when many of the Crusaders were still returning to their homes in Europe. King Richard, who had been captured by Leopold of Austria on his return journey to England, was believed to be still in captivity. The legendary Robin Hood, initially under the name of Locksley, is also a character in the story, as are his &#34;merry men&#34;. The character that Scott gave to Robin Hood in Ivanhoe helped shape the modern notion of this figure as a cheery noble outlaw. Having been adapted for the screen many times, Ivanhoe continues to boost interest in medieval history with its tale of knights in shining armour and it remains hugely popular with readers of all ages.</p><p>The Bookcassetteï¿½ format is a special recording technique developed as a means of condensing the full, unabridged audio text of a book to record it on fewer tapes. In order to listen to these tapes, you will need a cassette player with balance control to adjust left/right speaker output. Special adaptors to allow these tapes to be played on any cassette player are available through the publisher or some US retail electronics stores.In the twelfth century, Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe returns home to England from the Third Crusade to claim his inheritance and the love of the lady Rowena. The heroic adventures of this noble Saxon knight involve him in the struggle between Richard the Lion-Hearted and his malignant brother John: a conflict that brings Ivanhoe into alliance with the mysterious outlaw Robin Hood and his legendary fight for the forces of good.</p><h2>A Year in the World: Journeys of A Passionate Traveller</h2><p><p>The author who unforgettably captured the experience of starting a new life in Tuscany in bestselling travel memoirs expands her horizons to immerse herself&#x2014;and her readers&#x2014;in the sights, aromas, and treasures of twelve new special places. <br> <br><i>A Year in the World</i> is vintage Frances Mayes&#x2014;a celebration of the allure of travel, of serendipitous pleasures found in unlikely locales, of memory woven into the present, and of a joyous sense of quest. An ideal travel companion, Frances Mayes brings to the page the curiosity of an intrepid explorer, remarkable insights into the wonder of the everyday, and a compelling narrative style that entertains as it informs. <br><br>With her beloved Tuscany as a home base, Mayes travels to Spain, Portugal, France, the British Isles, and to the Mediterranean world of Turkey, Greece, the South of Italy, and North Africa. In Andalucï¿½a, she relishes the intersection of cultures. She cooks in Portugal, gathers ideas in the gardens of England and Scotland, takes a literary pilgrimage to Burgundy, discovers an ideal place to live in Mantova, and explores the essential Moroccan city of Fez. She rents houses among ordinary residents, shops at neighborhood markets, wanders the back streets, and everywhere contemplates the concept of home. While in Greece, she follows the classic Homeric voyage across the Aegean, lives in a bougainvillea-draped stone house in Crete, and then drives deep into the Mani. In Turkey with friends, she sails the ancient coast, hiking to archaeological sites and snorkeling over sunken Byzantine towns. Weaving together personal perceptions and informed commentary on art, architecture, history, landscape, and social and culinary traditions of each area, Mayes brings the immediacy of life in her temporary homes to the reader. An illuminating and passionate book that will be savored by all who loved <i>Under the Tuscan Sun, A Year in the World</i> is travel writing at its peak.</p></p><p><b>FRANCES MAYES </b>is the author of four books about Tuscany.

I'm for the new--no mournful backward glance. <i>Make tracks</i>, I write one night on the steamed kitchen window.<br><br>The year began with a break-in at my house while my husband and I were finishing dinner. Ed had just tipped the last of a <i>vino nobile</i> into our glasses. Laughing, we were talking about the turn of the year, with Nina Simone crooning "The Twelfth of Never" to us. We'd cleared the plates, the candles were burning down, and outside the dining room window we saw only our potted lemon trees, swaying snapdragons, and yellow Carolina jasmine, for January in California is a blessed season.<br><br>In a flash, everything changed. A man crashed through the living room window, screaming that he wanted to die, then loomed on the middle of the rug, his bundled body in ski jacket, droopy pants, and homeboy hat pulled down around his moony face. Even as I write this, my heart starts to pound.<br><br>"Give me a knife," he shouted. "I've never done this before, but I'm doing it now." I thought, not <i>does he have a gun will we die</i>, but <i>he's goofy</i>. Then terror pumped through every vein in my body. T<i>his can't be happening! </i>Somehow, we'd stood up. <i>Run.</i> My chair tipped over. He lunged into the dining room. I threw my glass of wine in his face, and as he wiped his eyes, we ran out the back door. "I want to die," he shouted to us as we fled into a street darkened by conscientious neighbors in the middle of the latest corruption-engineered energy crisis. Our house was blazing like the <i>Titanic</i>; lights flared in every window. Our intruder had been drawn to us like a fluttering moth toward the screen door on a soft southern night.<br><br>Ed grabbed a phone on the way out and somehow called 911 as he sprinted across the street. We ran to separate neighbors, hoping to find someone at home on Saturday night. Startled new Chinese neighbors brought me in and handed me the telephone, though they must have thought I was mad, while the intruder followed Ed across the street to our neighbors Arlene and Dan. Interrupted in the middle of a dinner party, they pulled Ed in and slammed the door. Then our intruder broke through their door--just as the police drove up.<br><br>That was the beginning. The drugged young man was on the street again in a month. I found his sunglasses in a flower bed. Expensive. I threw them in the trash. The year rolled on and doesn't bear thinking about. Suffice to say the words <i>surgery</i>, <i>hospitals</i>, <i>deaths</i>. As the sublime September weather arrived, we all experienced the mind-altering, world-shaking attack on America. Go, bad year. May the stars realign.<br><br>Now, Janus, my friend, I am going to Spain for a winter month in Andalucï¿½a. Andalucï¿½a, land of the orange and the olive tree. Land of passionate poets and flamenco dancers and late-night dinners with guitar music in jasmine-scented gardens.<br>Ed flew to Italy a week ago because, as always, we have some complicated building project in progress. En route to Spain, he has detoured to Bramasole, our house in Cortona, to see about the drilling of a well for a nine-hundred-year-old house we have bought in the mountains. We want to accomplish a historic restoration on this stone house built by hermit monks who followed Saint Francis of Assisi. When I last talked to him, the dowser had felt his stick bend in exactly the spot where I did not want a well and had drilled down a hundred meters without finding a drop. We are planning to meet in Madrid.<br><br>From San Francisco, I board a flight to Paris and am happy to see my seatmate take out a book instead of a computer. No white aura and tap-tapping for the ten-hour flight. She looks as if she could have been one of my colleagues at the university. Is she going to Europe to research a fresco cycle or to join an archaeological team at a Roman villa excavation? I take out my own book, ready to escape into silence for the duration. She smiles and asks, "What are you reading?"<br><br>"A biography of Federico Garcï¿½a Lorca--getting ready for Spain. What are you reading?"<br><br>"Oh, a book on John three thirteen."<br><br>"Three thirteen. I don't know that verse. We used to sing 'John three sixteen, John three sixteen' in rounds at Methodist Sunday school."<br><br>The flight attendant comes by with champagne and orange juice. "Just water," my seatmate and I say in unison. We begin to talk about travel and books, chatting easily, though I am, at first, waiting for a chance to retreat. We know nothing of each other and will part when the scramble to exit at Charles de Gaulle begins.<br><br>She asks a lot of questions. I tell her I am a former university teacher, now a full-time writer. I tell her about living part of the year in Italy, and that Italy has given me several books, written with joy. She probes. Are my books published? Are they popular? And if so, do I know why? What do I try to accomplish with my writing? How do I feel about people's responses to my books? On and on. I tell her that I'm embarking on the first of many travels and that I hope to write a book about my experiences. Why? What will I be looking for? I am drawn into lengthy explanations. I say I'm interested in the idea and fact of <i>home</i>. I'm going to places where I have dreamed of living and will try to settle down in each, read the literature, look at the gardens, shop for what's in season, try to feel <i>at home</i>. I'm talking more openly than usual with a stranger. Is she a psychiatrist?<br><br>"And you've never felt God's hand on yours?" She looks quizzically at me.<br><br>"No. I've felt lucky, though."<br><br>"Maybe you are bringing happiness to people through the will of God. Maybe." She smiles.<br><br>She answers my own questions evasively. She is holding something back, even in the basic exchanges, such as whether she is on vacation, that simple opening into conversation. Our little equation is out of balance. Finally, I ask bluntly, "What do you do?"<br><br>"I . . . I guess you could say I'm a speaker."<br><br>"On what subjects?"<br><br>Silence. She is gazing out the window. She is a very still person. "I'm part of a foundation. We try to help in communities with severe problems."<br><br>Vague. She sees my questioning look. She frowns. "We're involved in education, and orphanages, and churches."<br><br>"Oh, so it's a religious foundation? What religion are you?" I assume she is a Presbyterian or Methodist, a good volunteer for good works, or is involved in Catholic charities.<br><br>"I know this is strange, but I have a strong sense about you. I'll just tell you my journey." She then describes the surprise of her conversion, her subsequent adoption of six children from all over the world, her work in Africa and Russia. Her husband, a prominent lawyer, eventually had his own revelation and joins her in her missions. Dinner is served and we talk on.<br><br>"You've probably never met anyone like me, anyone who hears the voice of God."<br><br>"I think I haven't. You hear the voice of God?" Oh,<i> mamma mia</i>, I think.<br><br>"Yes, he's talking to me right now, all the time."<br>"What does he sound like?" I wonder if she is speaking metaphorically, living out a grand <i>as if</i>.<br><br>She laughs. "He's funny sometimes. Sometimes we dance. He's telling me about you, but I don't want you to think I'm a psychic with a neon sign in the window!"<br><br>I start to ask sarcastically if he is a good dancer and what kind of dances he leads her in--rhumba? But I don't. As a doubter with strong spiritual interests, I'm tantalized by her big holy spirit visitations. I imagine it feels like a mewling kitten being lifted in the jaws of an enormous mother cat and taken to safety. I'm ready myself but have never felt the slightest inkling that anything out there in the void is the least bit interested in the hairs on my head or the feathers of small sparrows. "If God is talking about me, I'd like to hear what he says because I've never heard from him before tonight." Where's the flight attendant? I'd like a big glass of wine. This is getting surreal. I'm thirty-five thousand feet above terra firma with someone who dances with God.<br><br>"Well, I will tell you that He says you have the gift of divine humility. How did you get that? It's so rare."<br><br>"Maybe it's a lack of confidence!"<br><br>"No, I've seen it in one priest, someone I consulted when I felt the urge to prophesy."<br><br>Whoa! Prophesy? "Oh, you're a prophet?" I toss this off casually, as though it were <i>Oh, you're from Memphis</i>.<br><br>She looks out the window. Sighs. "I know how it sounds. It's so <i>simple</i>." I see her struggling to explain. "I just wait to speak. I wait for God. Sometimes it's just sounds."<br><br>"Glossolalia?" She nods. "I've seen that. My friends and I used to peer in the windows at the holy roller and snake-handling churches way down in South Georgia." I don't say that those people fell to the floor writhing and drooling. That we ran away, scared out of our socks. This woman in her Dana Buchman suit and good haircut seems as sane as the United pilot of this plane.<br><br>"Have you ever heard of a Charismatic Prophet? That's my calling. I knew I was going to sit beside someone on this flight who would change my life. I always wanted to write. Now I hear how you do it and it frees me to try. God put me beside you.

In the tradition of Rizzoli&#x2019;s Albert Hadley and David Hicks, this is the first fully illustrated account of the career of Billy Baldwin (1903&#x2013;1983), one of the most important decorators of the twentieth century, whose work has influenced contemporary designers from Bunny Williams to Jeffrey Bilhuber. A native of Baltimore, Baldwin&#x2019;s work caught the eye of eminent New York decorator Ruby Ross Wood. She invited him to join her firm, saying his work stood out "like a beacon of light in the boredom of the houses around it." Baldwin&#x2019;s style was a revelation simultaneously classical and modernist, tailored and clean, yet dramatically colored, and above all American. An enemy of clutter and conspicuous wealth, he favored natural materials and comfortable furniture.</p><p><b>Adam Lewis</b> is the author of <i>Van Day Truex, Albert Hadley, </i>and <i>The Great Lady Decorators</i>. <b><br>Albert Hadley</b> is one of the most important American interior designers of the twentieth century."Adam Lewis's new book, 'Billy Baldwin: The Great American Decorator' (Rizzoli), surveys the life and career of the man whose pared-down versions of the slipper chair and brass bookshelves became famous, and whose work continues to influence designers long after his death in 1983...

This time out, the irrepressible Mrs. Murphy finds herself paw-deep in a compelling case of old ties, old sins, and all-too-present danger.<br><br>Emotions are running high around tiny Crozet, Virginia, among the Class of 1980, as plans get under way for the upcoming twentieth high school reunion. There's nothing like a reunion to stir up memories, rivalries, and insecurities. It's even put Crozet's normally placid postmistress, Mary Minor "Harry" Haristeen, who's on the organizing committee, on edge, as she wonders if everything will come together on time.<br><br>Still, when each member of the class receives an anonymous letter edged in the Crozet High School colors that reads "You'll never get old," Harry takes it as a compliment. Others think it's a joke. But even blitzed out on fresh catnip, Mrs. Murphy senses a much more sinister meaning. And the sly tiger cat is soon proven right...when divinely handsome Charlie Ashcraft, the class womanizer, turns up dead with a bullet between his eyes. At first folks around Crozet figure that when a man is sleeping with other men's wives, trouble is sure to follow. But when another threatening note to the members of the Class of 1980 is followed by the murder of a second classmate, it becomes all too clear that someone is determined to spoil this reunion...someone who has waited twenty years to take bitter revenge.<br><br>What could have happened so long ago to trigger such rage? While Harry, whose high school memories consist of football games and first love, tries to make sense of the crimes, it's up to Mrs. Murphy, her feline pal Pewter, and the corgi Tee Tucker to try to sniff out the truth. Yet when ugly rumors surface and Harry herself has a brush with violence, Mrs. Murphy is the first to realize that in the killer's mind, Harry's been chosen Most Likely to Die. And now, unless the daring tiger cat and her animal pals can stop a relentless killer, Crozet High's twentieth reunion may very well be Harry Haristeen's last....</p><p>When a mystery author claims her cat as coauthor, it's a fairly safe bet that the team won't be producing disturbing psychological thrillers or hard-edged legal procedurals. And indeed, Rita Mae Brown and her cat, Sneaky Pie, have carved out a comfortable niche for themselves in the cozy category, spinning tales (<i>Rest in Pieces</i>; <i>Murder, She Meowed</i>; <i>Cat on the Scent</i>) around the goings-on in Crozet, a small Virginia town where everyone knows everyone else and recipes and gossip are exchanged over the post office counter. Mary Minor Haristeen ("Harry") is Crozet's postmistress and the proud owner of two cats, Mrs. Murphy and Pewter, and one corgi, Tee Tucker--animals with an uncanny ability to sniff out secrets and hidden motives as well as mice and roast beef.<p> <i>Pawing Through the Past</i> capitalizes on the myriad subtle relationships that form the backbone of small-town culture, and which Brown and Sneaky Pie have carefully woven throughout the Mrs. Murphy series. In a nicely appropriate nod to that culture's rivalries and alliances, Brown has chosen a high school reunion--traditional hotbed of simmering unease--as her mise-en-scï¿½ne. When each member of the Crozet High Class of 1980 receives an anonymous note stating, "You'll never get old," most take it as a joke or a compliment. But when the class womanizer turns up with a bullet between his eyes, and more notes--and more bodies--start appearing, Harry and her menagerie find themselves at the center of a revenge plot 20 years in the making.</p><p> Brown's latest is replete with the sly asides that have endeared her to animal lovers--"Cats are by instinct and inclination dedicated anarchists"--and with the naively humorous "conversations" between the animals themselves. When Pewter, watching a team of police officers wrestling a stiff corpse out of a dumpster, wonders, "Why don't they just break his arms and legs?" Murphy replies knowingly, "They'd pass out. Humans are touchy about their dead." Unfortunately, these favorable attributes can't quite mask an incoherent plot, nor Brown's awkwardly pompous social commentary: "By and large, the women looked better than the men, testimony to the cultural pressure for women to fuss over themselves." But Brown's legions of fans will doubtlessly forgive these shortcomings, concentrating instead on the antics of a memorable four-legged and furry trio. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>"As feline collaborators go, you couldn't ask for better than Sneaky Pie Brown." <br>--<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"Mrs. Murphy is [a] cat who detects her way into our hearts."<br>--<i>San Francisco Sunday Examiner &amp; Chronicle Book Review</i><br></p><h2>Nearing Home Large Print (Life, Faith, and Finishing Well)</h2><p>Billy Graham reflects on his life</p><p></p><h2>Three</h2><p>Combined in this one-volume edition are these three classics: The Way of Zen is a clear and comprehensive account of Zen Buddhism in its historical and cultural setting.

Psychotherapy East and West compares ways of Eastern liberation - Buddhism, Taoism, Vedanta, and Yoga - to the way of Western liberation, psychotherapy, finding that all seek to relieve the vicious cycle of seemingly endless attempts to solve a false problem.</p><p></p><h2>Field guide to edible wild plants</h2><p>This illustrated guide to North American wild edibles has been a nature classic for over thirty years.

Rashid uses humorous, feel-good stories to relate his techniques of teaching horses by examining their view of the world. This book is a must-have for compassionate horse trainers and owners. Tales of Arabs, appaloosas, and paints mistrusted and mistreated because of their breed will give readers a new perspective on these breeds and others. This new edition features added introductory notes for each chapter that contribute to a better understanding of Rashid&#x2019;s philosophy and methods.</p><p><b>Mark Rashid</b> is an author and horse trainer. His books, such as <i>Considering the Horse</i> and <i>Whole Heart, Whole Horse</i>, follow his training philosophy, which is to find training solutions by considering the horse's point of view. The author of seven books, Rashid was featured on the PBS Nature series.The title spells out one of the book's twin morals; the other is "Kindliness is better than force." Rashid (Considering the Horse), a professional horse trainer and frequent contributor to western equestrian magazines, reiterates these two themes ad nauseam, illustrating them in long-winded and meandering anecdotes, many of them reminiscences of his childhood mentor and later employer, "the old man." Admittedly Rashid has extensive experience with horses and has encountered a wide range of colorful characters in his lifetime out West. However, readers looking to glean hard information about equine behavior or training techniques will find few in proportion to the ocean of verbiage. Those who just want to cozy up with some folksy horse tales may find themselves wishing that Rashid had reined in his prolixity.

When the text falls into the hands of Rabbi Kalman Stern, he has no idea that his lonely life of intellectual pursuits is about to change once he opens the book. Soon afterward, he meets astronomer Isabel Benveniste, a woman of science who stirs his soul as no woman has for many years. But Kalman has much to learn before he can unlock his heart and let true love into his life.

It easily eclipsed the big red neon Tower Records sign and silhouetted all the sheets of newspaper scurrying over Broadway's empty sidewalks. It ricocheted off the windows on the building across the street and then flooded Kalman's office. And for a moment, light was everywhere. And everything was light.<br><br>Kalman opened the door and squinted in the brightness. Winded from climbing three flights up the utility stairwell, he was proud his forty-six-year-old constitution could still take them in stride. He set his coffee on the desk, hung his parka over the back of a chair, and began unpacking his bag--teaching notes, books, a folder of last week's marked-up homework. Finally, he peeled the tape from the flap of a bubble-wrap envelope protecting a very old volume of Zohar, the master text of Kabbalah. Kalman had picked it up in Israel decades earlier; the caretaker of a little out-of-the-way synagogue had given it to him.<br><br>"Here," the old man had said. "Take it, it's yours--has your name on it."<br><br>So he took it. He'd been using it ever since as a pedagogic prop, a teaching aid for his courses on mysticism. How could he possibly have imagined that, after all these years, the back cover of the book was about to come unglued and give birth to another page? That's the way it is with a good book: Just when you think you've read all its words, the damn thing falls apart in your hands and you have to start all over again.<br><br>The leather of the cover was long gone; only the interior pastedowns had survived the continents and centuries. Similarly, all that remained of the binding was naked stitch work. The back cover was even more distressed--a sandwich of several barely-glued-together and delaminating layers. The extremes of New York's climate had taken their toll on whatever adhesive properties the old glue might still have possessed. Indeed, the book was so insubstantial, it seemed more pneumatic than corporeal--a child's helium balloon in imminent danger of floating away. The paper of the pages had a bluish cast and was so softly textured, it felt like cloth; wormholes embroidered the edges and much of the gutter. Many margins were embellished with handwritten notes. The title page bore the names or biblical verses poetically alluding to the names of generations of owners. And at the bottom there was printed a verse from the Book of Job: "What is hidden shall come into the light."<br><br>Then, like a man swearing an oath in court, Kalman placed his open palm on the book and mused, "And what was hidden has come to me!" He closed his eyes and smiled.<br>Kalman's office was at the back of the library stacks, a destination distinguished primarily by the fact that it could be reached from the stairway door by at least half a dozen different paths. And each one was through a different maze of aisles created by floor-to-ceiling gray metal shelves of books and--if you bothered to flip on the switches as you walked by--illuminated by overhead fluorescent lights. There were routes for every mood: You could walk through medieval Europe and the Holocaust; you could walk through commentaries on the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, or the Koran; you could walk through the Talmud, the history of Israel, Jewish ethics, or Jewish humor. But no matter which path you chose, it was through books, literally thousands and thousands of them, all waiting patiently for readers like flowers for bees.<br><br>"So you're interested in becoming a rabbi. . . ." Kalman set down her letter and smiled at the red-haired young woman sitting on the other side of his desk.<br><br>"Yes, I am, Rabbi Stern. I'm particularly interested in Kabbalah."<br><br>"Which is why, I suppose, the dean asked me to meet with you."<br><br>She nodded.<br><br>Kalman looked over his reading glasses. "Does God talk to you?"<br><br>"Not that I know of."<br><br>"Well, that's a good sign."<br><br>"I majored in classics and religion at Brown. I even took a year of Hebrew. For the past several years, I have tried Buddhist meditation, spent six months in India on an ashram, and then last year I had an epiphany. I was at my nephew's bar mitzvah, and it dawned on me that Judaism must have something mystical, too."<br><br>"Indeed," said Kalman. He reached over, picked up the Zohar, and handed it to her. "Be gentle, it's very, very old."<br><br>"When was it published?"<br><br>"Look at this line, here," he said, pointing to the verse from Job at the bottom of the title page.<br><br>"Why are some of the letters bigger than the others?"<br><br>"Gematria."<br><br>"You mean where each letter has a numerical equivalent?"<br><br>"Excellent." He handed her a pencil and a notepad. "How's your arithmetic?"<br><br>"You'll have to help me."<br><br>"Let's first wait and see if you need any. . . . Remember, only the <i>big</i> letters."<br><br>"Okay," she said, "<i>Ayin</i> is . . . Wait, don't tell me, <i>mem</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>samekh</i>, <i>ayin</i>, yes, seventy; <i>lamed</i> is thirty; <i>yod</i> is ten. . . . <i>Tsadi</i>. What's <i>tsadi</i>?"<br><br>"Ninety," said Kalman.<br><br>"Thank you. The <i>alephs</i>, of course, is one; the <i>vav</i> is six; and the <i>resh</i> is . . ."<br><br>"Two hundred. Relax, this is not a test."<br><br>She tallied the numbers and replied with a hesitant grin, "Four hundred and eight?"<br><br> "Bingo!" said Kalman, clapping his hands together in mock applause. "Pub date hidden in a scriptural verse."<br><br>"But how is four hundred and seven a date?"<br><br>"The publisher assumes you know which millennium you're in. So you add the present millennium and get 5407. Then subtract that from the current Hebrew year, 5757, leaving 350. Finally, subtract that from this year, 1997, which tells us the book was published in 1647. Piece of cake. And if that's too complicated for you, just add 240 to the Hebrew year and correct for the proper millennium."<br><br>"But I don't understand, Rabbi Stern. Why didn't they just put the date?"<br><br>"Because the publisher believed that everything worth knowing is already in the Hebrew Bible. That's what it means to say that God gave it. We only have to learn how to read and interpret those words correctly. That's what we're supposed to be doing here in this school: learning how to read them properly."<br>SAFED: ITERATION ONE<br><br>Kalman watched while the young woman contemplated the book in her hands.<br><br>"It's really beautiful, Rabbi Stern. What is it?"<br><br>"The red letters at the top of the page."<br><br>Falteringly, she sounded out the three words: "<i>Ha-Zohar al ha-Torah</i>. The Zohar on the Torah--awesome!" Her cheeks flushed. "I've read about it, but I've never seen one before."<br><br>"You are holding the first of a three-volume set that purports to be the transcript of the peripatetic teachings and adventures of the second-century mystic Shimon bar Yohai and his companions as they wander the Galilean hills. Like other rabbinic texts, it humbly claims only to elaborate on the real meaning of the Bible. Gershom Scholem . . . you know about him?"<br><br>"Historian of mysticism?"<br><br>"Yes. Scholem once pointed out that, in a revealed religion like Judaism, creativity must masquerade as commentary."<br><br>"I don't understand."<br><br>"If everything worth knowing is already in the Torah, then no one can say anything new of any real value. So if you're a Jew and you have a creative idea, you must begin by demonstrating how it's already in scripture."<br><br>"And so that's why the Zohar claims to elucidate the Torah?"<br><br>"Correct. It was Scholem who also first suggested that the Zohar is a mystical novel. That would make the Zohar a treatise on Kabbalah that has been disguised to <i>look like</i> a commentary on the Torah, which, in turn, is masquerading as a novel. Scholars now agree with Scholem that it was pseudepigraphically written by the Castilian Kabbalist Moshe de Leon toward the end of the thirteenth century."<br><br>"It sort of gives ghostwriting a new dimension, doesn't it," she said.<br><br>Kalman laughed. "Well, if you believe in the transmigration of souls, I suppose. According to at least one document, Moshe de Leon feared that no one would read something he wrote, so he invented--or I suppose you could say channeled--a more prestigious author. But whoever wrote it, the Jews bought the whole thing. After the Hebrew Bible and the Talmud, the Zohar has effectively become the third canonical sacred text in Judaism."<br><br>"May I ask, Rabbi, how you got the book?"<br><br>He rotated it in his hands, examining it in the light. "It's actually a pretty good story," Kalman said. "The caretaker of a little synagogue up in Safed gave it to me. It must've been twenty, maybe twenty-five years ago. I was leading a tour of Israel for members of my part-time congregation. We were up in Safed, in the Galilee. After visiting the synagogue of Isaac Luria, the group had had enough of my history of Kabbalah and wanted to go shopping in the artists' quarter. So I wandered off down the hillside, alone. Within only a few blocks the buildings began to thin out and the narrow street became just a rocky, zigzag path down the side of the mountain. That's when I noticed the entrance to the courtyard of a small Spanish-Portuguese-style synagogue. I was tired, the gate was ajar, and the place was deserted. So I walked in. . . ."<br>Kalman closed his eyes for a moment, recalling tha...</p><h2>Listen To Me Satan: Exercising Authority Over the Devil in Jesus&#39; Name</h2><p>This is the true story of Carlos Annacondia, a humble man whose ministry has brought an amazing revival to Argentina and to all of South America.

The daughter of a powerful lord, Sarah is raised in great luxury, but balks at the arranged marriage her father has planned for her. The groom is handsome and a nobleman, but on their wedding day, Sarah panics and impulsively flees to the vast, empty marshes outside the city walls. There she meets a young man, Abram, a member of a nomadic tribe of outsiders. Drawn to this exotic stranger, Sarah spends the night with him, but reluctantly returns to her father&#x2019;s house. But on her return, still desperate to avoid another wedding, she drinks a poisonous potion that will make her barren and thus unfit for marriage. <br><br>Many years later, Abram&#x2019;s people return to Ur, and he discovers that the lost, rebellious girl from the marsh has been transformed into the most splendid and revered woman in Sumeria--the high priestess of the goddess Ishtar. But the memory of their night together has always haunted Sarah, and she gives up her exalted life to join Abram's tribe and follow the one true God, an invisible deity who speaks only to Abram. It is then that her journey truly begins--a journey that holds the key to her remarkable destiny as the mother of nations.<br><br>From the great ziggurat of Ishtar and the fertile valleys of Canaan to the bedchamber of the mighty Pharaoh himself, Sarah&#x2019;s story reveals an ancient world full of beauty, intrigue, and miracles.</p><p>MAREK HALTER was born in Poland in 1936. During World War II, he and his parents narrowly escaped from the Warsaw ghetto. After a time in Russia and Uzbekistan, they emigrated to France in 1950. There Halter studied pantomime with Marcel Marceau and embarked on a career as a painter that led to several international exhibitions. In 1967, he founded the International Committee for a Negotiated Peace Agreement in the Near East and played a crucial role in the organization of the first official meetings between Palestinians and Israelis.<br><br>In the 1970s, Marek Halter turned to writing. He first published <b>The Madman and the Kings</b>, which was awarded the Prix Aujourd&#x2019;hui in 1976. He is also the author of several internationally acclaimed, bestselling historical novels, including <b>The Messiah</b>, <b>The Mysteries of Jerusalem</b>, and <b>The Book of Abraham</b>, which won the Prix du Livre Inter.

Dawn was breaking, and there was just enough light for her to see the blood on her hands. She closed her eyes to hold back the tears.<br><br>She did not need to look down to know that her tunic was stained. She could feel the fine woollen cloth sticking wetly to her thighs and knees.<br><br>Here it was again! A sharp pain, like a demon's claw moving between her hips! She stood frozen, her eyes half closed. The pain faded as suddenly as it had come.<br><br>Sarai held out her soiled hands in front of her. She should have implored Inanna, the almighty Lady of Heaven, but no word passed her lips. She was petrified. Fear, disgust, and denial mingled in her mind.<br><br>Only a moment ago, she had woken suddenly, her belly ringed with pain, and put her hands between her thighs. Into this blood that was flowing out of her for the first time. The bridal blood. The blood that creates life.<br><br>It had not come as she had been promised it would. It was not like dew or honey. It flowed as if from an invisible wound. In a moment of panic, she had seen herself being emptied of blood like a ewe under the sacrificial knife.<br><br>She had reacted like a silly child, and now she felt ashamed. But her terror had been so great that she had sat up moaning on her bed and rushed outside.<br><br>Now, in the growing light of day, she looked at her bloodstained hands as if they did not belong to her. Something strange was happening in her body, something that had obliterated her happy childhood at a stroke.<br><br>Tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow, and all the days and years to come, would be different. She knew what awaited her. What awaited every girl in whom the bridal blood flowed. Her handmaid Sililli and all the other women in the household would laugh. They would dance and sing and give thanks to Nintu, the Midwife of the World.<br><br>But Sarai felt no joy. At that moment, she wished her body was someone else's.<br><br>She took a deep breath. The smell of the night fires floating in the cool air of early morning calmed her a little. The coolness of the bricks beneath her bare feet did her good. There was no noise in the house or the gardens. Not even the flight of a bird. The whole city seemed to be holding its breath, waiting for the sun to burst forth. For the moment it was still hidden on the other side of the world, but the ocher light that preceded it was spreading over the horizon like oil.<br><br>Abruptly Sarai turned and went back through the curtain into her bedchamber. In the dim light, it was just possible to make out the big bedstead where Nisaba and Lillu lay sleeping. Without moving, Sarai listened to her sisters' regular breathing. At least she had not woken them.<br><br>She advanced cautiously to her own bed. She wanted to sit down, but hesitated.<br><br>She thought of the advice Sililli had given her. Change your tunic, take off the sheet, roll the soiled straw in it, go to the door and take some balls of wool dipped in sweet oil, wash your thighs and genitals with them, then take some other balls, scented with essence of terebinth, and use them to absorb the blood. All she had to do was perform a few simple actions. But she couldn't. She didn't know why, but she couldn't bear even the thought of touching herself.<br><br>Anger was beginning to replace fear. What if Nisaba and Lillu discovered her and roused the whole household, crying out across the men's courtyard, "Sarai is bleeding, Sarai has the bridal blood!"<br><br>That would be the most disgusting thing of all.<br><br>Why did the blood running between her thighs make her more adult? Why, at the same time as she gained the freedom to speak, was she going to lose the freedom to act? For that was what was going to happen. Now, in exchange for a few silver shekels or a few measures of barley, her father could give her to a man. A stranger she might have to hate for the rest of her days. Why did things have to happen that way? Why not another way?<br><br>Sarai tried hard to dismiss this chaos of thoughts, this mixture of sadness and anger, but she couldn't. She couldn't even remember a single word of the prayers Sililli had taught her. It was as if a demon had banished them from her heart and mind. Lady Moon would be furious. She would send down a curse on her.<br><br>Anger and denial swept through her again. She couldn't stay here in the dark. But she didn't want to wake Sililli. Once Sililli took charge, things would really start.<br><br>She had to flee. To flee beyond the wall that enclosed the city, perhaps as far as the bend in the Euphrates, where the labyrinth of the lower city and the reedy lagoons stretched over dozens of *s. That was another world, a fascinating but hostile world, and Sarai wasn't brave enough to go there. Instead, she took refuge in the huge garden, which was full of a hundred kinds of trees and flowers and vegetables and surrounded by a wall that in places was higher than the highest rooms. She hid in a tamarisk grove clinging to the oldest part of the wall, where sun, wind, and rain had, in places, dissolved the stack of bricks and reduced it to a hard ocher dust. When the tamarisks were in bloom, their huge pink flowers spread like luxuriant hair over the wall and could be seen clear across the city. They had become the distinguishing feature of the house of Ichbi Sum-Usur, son of Ella Dum-tu, Lord of Ur, merchant and high-ranking official in the service of King Amar-Sin, who ruled the empire of Ur by the will of almighty Ea.<br>"SARAI! Sarai!!"<br><br>She recognized the voices: Lillu's piercing shriek and Sililli's more muted and anxious tones. Some of the handmaids had already searched the garden, but finding nothing, had gone away again.<br><br>Silence returned, except for the murmur of the water flowing in the irrigation channels and the chirping of the birds.<br><br>From where she was, Sarai could see everything but could not be seen. Her father's house was one of the most beautiful in the royal city. It was shaped like a hand enclosing a huge rectangular central courtyard, which was reached through the main entrance. At either end, the courtyard was separated by two green-and-yellow brick buildings, open only for receptions and celebrations, and by two smaller courtyards, the women's and the men's. The men's quarters, with their white staircases, overhung the temple of the family's ancestors, the storehouses, and the room where her father's scribes worked, while the women's chambers were built above the kitchens, the handmaids' dormitories, and the chamber of blood. Both opened onto a broad terrace, shaded by bowers of vines and wisteria, with a view of the gardens. The terrace allowed the men to join the women at night without having to cross the courtyards.<br><br>From her grove, Sarai could also see a large part of the city, and, towering over it like a mountain, the ziggurat, the Sublime Platform. Not a day went by that she did not come here to admire the gardens of the ziggurat. They were a lake of foliage between earth and sky, full of every flower and every tree the gods had sown on the earth. From this riot of greenery emerged the steps, covered in black-and-white ceramics, that led up to the Sublime Bedchamber, with its lapis lazuli columns and walls. There, once a year, the king of Ur was united with the Lady of Heaven.<br><br>Today, though, she had eyes only for what was happening in the house. Everything seemed to have calmed down. Sarai had the impression they had stopped searching for her. When the handmaids had appeared earlier in the garden, she had been tempted to join them. But now it was too late for her to leave her hiding place. With every hour that passed, she was more at fault. If anyone saw her in this state, they would scream with fright and turn away, shielding their eyes as if they had seen a woman possessed by demons. It was unthinkable that she could show herself like this to the women. It would be a blemish on her father's house. She had to stay here and wait until nightfall. Only then could she perform her ablutions in the garden's irrigation basin. After that, she would go and ask Sililli for forgiveness. With enough tears, and enough terror in her voice, to mollify her.<br><br>Until then she had to forget her thirst and the heat that was gradually transforming the still air into a strange miasma of dry dust.<br>SHE stiffened when she heard the shouts.<br><br>"Sarai! Answer me, Sarai! I know you're there! Do you want to die today, with the shame of the gods on you?"<br><br>She recognized the thick calves, the yellow-and-white tunic with its black border instantly.<br><br>"Sililli?"<br><br>"Who else were you expecting?" the handmaid retorted, in an angry whisper.<br><br>"How did you manage to find me?"<br><br>Sililli took a few steps back. "Stop your chattering," she said, lowering her voice even more, "and come out of there right now before anyone sees you."<br><br>"You mustn't look at me," Sarai warned.<br><br>She emerged from the copse, straightening up with difficulty, her muscles aching from her long immobility.<br><br>Sililli stifled a cry. "Forgive her, almighty Ea! Forgive her!"<br><br>Sarai did not dare look Sililli in the face. She stared down at her short, round shadow on the ground, and saw her raise her arms to heaven then hug them to her bosom.<br><br>"Almighty Lady of Heaven," Sililli muttered, in a choked voice, "forgive me for having seen her soiled face and hands! She is only a child, holy Inanna. Nintu will soon purify her."<br><br>Sarai restrained herself from rushing into the handmaid's arms. "I'm so sorry," she said, in a barely audible whisper. "I didn't do as you told me to. I couldn't."<br><br>She did not have time to say more. A linen sheet was flung over her, covering her from head to foot, and Sililli's hands clasped her waist. Now Sarai no longer needed to hold ba...</p><h2>McNally&#39;s Secret</h2><p>Accustomed to helping the high society of Palm Beach cover up its scandals, private investigator Archy McNally agrees to assist a wealthy matron find a missing block of priceless stamps when the case uncovers a shocking secret from his own past</p><p>Lawrence Sanders, one of America's most popular novelists, was the author of more than twenty-two bestsellers.<b> </b>Glib, suave Archy McNally makes discreet investigations for the gentry of tony, decadent Palm Beach. This latest adventure begins with a stolen rare stamp, for which he searches through some skeleton-filled closets, including his own. But it hardly matters. For the reader, the delight of McNally's cases lies less in the plot than in the Dickensian characters he encounters (and beds), his banter with them, and his comments on them. All these are amplified through the sensibility of Adam Henderson. Not at all suave, he has a fey, untrained sound. And yet, by virtue of his own puckish touch, expressiveness, and verve, he gives a particularly satisfying rendition. He takes a while to get used to, but the patience pays off.

The insular island community initially welcomes her as the teacher in their one-room schoolhouse; but when she champions a clutch of neglected children, she finds herself thrust in the midst of a smoldering conflict between two prominent families. In a time when lobster &#x201c;trapheads&#x201d; were knit by hand and mail arrived weekly by boat, the prospect of a lobster war between the Bennetts and Campions threatens the livelihoods of everyone who calls Bennett&#x2019;s Island home. She further disturbs the precarious peace of the island when she opens her heart to handsome and thoughtful Steve Bennett, setting her further at odds with the rival Campions. <br><br>Philippa must grapple with her love and sense of loyalty to her deceased husband, even as her feelings for Steve Bennett bloom against the rugged coastal landscape. She longs to be reunited with her son, but she&#x2019;s troubled by the specter of latent strife that lies beneath the tranquil surface of the island community.

An orgasm without exhaustion or convoluted gymnastics. An orgasm that you control. Thanks to Barbara Keesling, Ph.D., this type of sexual fulfillment can now be any woman's reality. Dr. Keesling has identified the cul-de-sac -- an area of extreme sensitivity in the vaginal canal that enables any woman to have a Super Sexual Orgasm! Normally hidden beneath the uterus and just beyond the cervix, the cul-de-sac is so extraordinarily rich in sensitive nerve endings that the slightest contact can trigger a powerful, consuming, instantaneous orgasm.To reveal this secret and bring this ultimate sensation into your sex life, Dr. Keesling has devised a series of simple exercises designed to tighten the PC muscle, lift and flatten the uterus, and expose the usually hidden cul-de-sac. These exercises can work for all women -- from the highly orgasmic to the silent majority who have been suffering snoregasms. The cul-de-sac will become a woman's best-loved secret, for it will allow her to have consistent, euphoric orgasms that she can fully control. Dr. Keesling also includes sensual exercises for women to practice after they have mastered the Super Sexual Orgasm and exercises for couples to practice together, so that women can fully incorporate Super Sexual Orgasm into their lives in a mind-body-spirit approach.<p>Barbara Keesling, Ph.D., is the author of <em>Talk Sexy to the One You Love, How to Make Love All Night </em>&nbsp; and <em> Sexual Pleasure.</em> She has taught human sexuality and psychopathology at several southern California universities.</p><p>"What is the one word that is pivotal to female sexuality? Control.What I'm saying is this: Women want to have control of their sexual energies. They want to fully enjoy every scintilla of their lovemaking, from sensual caressing to supersonic climaxes, and once you discover the magic of Super Sexual Orgasm, you will be able to decide if you want to have your explosive climax at the beginning of intercourse or wait till your partner is on the verge of orgasm or have multiple explosive orgasms or have it all! All of this is available to you. You will have the control. Isn't this what you want?" -- Barbara Keesling, Ph.D.</p></p><p>Barbara Keesling has worked as a sex surrogate and sex therapist; earned a doctorate in psychology; written several bedside guides on lovemaking including <em>Sexual Healing,</em> <em>Sexual Pleasure,</em> and <em>How to Make Love All Night;</em> and taught human sexuality and psychopathology at Pepperdine University in southern California. <p>Keesling's expertise has been featured in numerous national magazines such as <em>Glamour,</em> <em>Cosmopolitan,</em> <em>Redbook,</em> and <em>Marie Claire,</em> and she appeared in an erotic <em>Playboy</em> pictorial. She is a frequent guest on national TV and radio talk shows.</p>"Once experienced, it permanently redefines a woman's understanding of her own sexuality." -- <i>-- Barbara Keesling, Ph.D.</i></p><h2>State of Change, A: Forgotten Landscapes of California</h2><p>Vernal pools, protected lagoons, grassy hills rich in bunchgrasses and, where the San Francisco Bay is today, ancient bison and mammoths roaming a vast grassland. Through the use of historical ecology, Laura Cunningham walks through these forgotten landscapes to uncover secrets about the past, explore what our future will hold, and experience the ever-changing landscape of California.<p>Combining the skill of an accomplished artist with a passion for landscapes and training as a naturalist, Cunningham has spent over two decades pouring over historical accounts, paleontology findings, and archaeological data. Traveling with paintbox in hand, she tracked the remaining vestiges of semi-pristine landscape like a detective, seeking clues that revealed the California of past centuries. She traveled to other regions as well, to sketch grizzly bears, wolves, and other magnificent creatures that are gone from California landscapes. In her studio, Cunningham created paintings of vast landscapes and wildlife from the raw data she had collected, observations in the wild, and knowledge of ecological laws and processes.</p><p>Through <i>A State of Change</i>, readers are given the pure pleasure of wandering through these wondrous and seemingly exotic scenes of Old California and understanding the possibilities for both change and conservation in our present-day landscape. <i>A State of Change</i> is as vital as it is visionary.</p></p><p>Laura Cunningham, an artist and naturalist, studied paleontology and biology at the University of California, Berkeley, and has worked at various field biology jobs for the California Department of Fish and Game, U.S. Geological Survey, and others, getting to know such species as the Owens Valley pupfish, southern California steelhead trout, Yosemite toad, and Panamint alligator lizard. Simultaneously, she has been studying and painting California&#39;s historic and living wildlife, flora, and unique landscapes. She lives with her husband and pet iguanas on a ranch next to Death Valley National Park, where she cofounded the group Basin and Range Watch to explore the historical ecology of the desert ecosystems of California and Nevada and to protect them.''A California classic.''--Steve Heilig, <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><p> ''A natural history masterpiece.''--Matt Kettmann, <i>Santa Barbara Independent</i></p><p> ''Cunningham's remarkable work reminds me of the multitalented naturalists of old.

The bestselling author of <b>Los Alamos</b> returns with a thrilling new novel of suspense, romance, and intrigue.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Washington, 1950.&nbsp;&nbsp;The trouble with history, Nick Kotlar's father tells him, is that you have to live through it before you know how it'll come out.&nbsp;&nbsp;And for Walter Kotlar, a high-level State Department official, the stakes couldn't be higher: an ambitious congressman has accused him of treason.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Nick watches helplessly, his family's privileged world is turned upside down in a frenzy of klieg lights and banging gavels.<br><br>Then one snowy night the chief witness against his father plunges to her death and his father flees, leaving only an endless mystery and the stain of his defection.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be better, Nick is told, to think of him as dead.<br><br>But twenty years later Walter Kotlar is still alive, and he enlists Molly, a young journalist, to bring Nick a disturbing message.&nbsp;&nbsp;He badly wants to see his son; after two decades of silence and isolation, he is desperate to end his own Cold War.&nbsp;&nbsp;Resentful but intrigued, Nick agrees to accompany Molly to Soviet-occupied Czechoslovakia for the painful reunion.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Once in Prague, Nick finds a clandestine world where nothing is what it seems--not the beautiful city, shadowy with menace; not the woman with whom he falls in love; and most of all not the man he thinks he no longer knows, yet still knows better than anyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;For Walter Kotlar has an impossible request: he wants to come home and he wants Nick to help.&nbsp;&nbsp;He also has a valuable secret about what really happened the night he walked out of Nick's life--and about the deadly conspiracy that still threatens them.<br><br><b>The Prodigal Spy</b> is a story of fathers and sons and the loyalties that transcend borders, and of a young man's search for the truth buried in his own past, when a national drama was made personal and history itself became a crime story.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like <b>Los Alamos</b>, this is at once an ingenious mystery, a love story, and a masterly recreation of an era whose legacy haunts our own.</p><p>Joseph Kanon's debut thriller, <i>Los Alamos</i>, captivated readers and critics alike and was awarded the 1998 Edgar Award for Best First Novel. <i>The Prodigal Spy</i>, set in the aftermath of the Manhattan Project, offers a glimpse at cold war espionage and a very personal story about the effects of McCarthyism and the paranoia that it spawned. Once again, Kanon effortlessly weaves together history and fiction in prose that is thick with period details. The real achievement of the book, though, is the author's strong sense of his narrative center, Nick Kotlar. <p> The novel begins in 1950 in the Kotlar home in Washington, D.C., as young Nick tries to make sense of the masses of reporters who have gathered outside his house. Though his parents struggle to shield him from the truth, he inadvertently sees a newsreel that reveals his father's predicament: State Department undersecretary Walter Kotlar is under the intense scrutiny of Congressman Kenneth Welles of the House Un-American Activities Committee. Kanon perfectly captures the sensibilities of a child with a parent in peril; disbelieving Nick becomes a fledgling spy, trying to erase any clues in his home that might support Welles and his committee. But one night, after an explosive conversation with Nick's mother, his father disappears. That same night, the woman who had accused Walter Kotlar of spying commits suicide--or was she murdered? In 1953, Mr. Kotlar gives a press conference from Moscow announcing his defection. The book then moves to London in 1969, where Nick meets a young woman who tells him that not only is his father still alive but he has been keeping tabs on his son for the 19 years since he fled to the Soviet Union. This revelation draws Nick into a meeting with the seriously ill elder Kotlar and propels Nick into some intelligence gathering of his own--to uncover the man who caused Walter Kotlar's defection and who killed his father's accuser. With <i>The Prodigal Spy</i>, Kannon has once again breathed new life into spy fiction. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>Acclaim for <b>Los Alamos</b>:<p>"Compelling. . . .

Ranajit Guha&#x2014;intellectual founder of the groundbreaking and influential Subaltern Studies Group&#x2014;describes from the peasants&#x2019; viewpoint the relations of dominance and subordination in rural India from 1783 to 1900. <br> Challenging the idea that peasants were powerless agents who rebelled blindly against British imperialist oppression and local landlord exploitation, Guha emphasizes their awareness and will to effect political change. He suggests that the rebellions represented the birth of a theoretical consciousness and asserts that India&#x2019;s long subaltern tradition lent power to the landmark insurgence led by Mahatma Gandhi. Yet as long as landlord authority remains dominant in a ruling culture, Guha claims, all mass struggles will tend to model themselves after the unfinished projects documented in this book. <br> Students and scholars will welcome this paperback edition of Guha&#x2019;s 1983 original, which was distributed on a limited scale in the United States. It will influence new generations studying colonialism, postcolonialism, subaltern studies, historiography, anthropology, and Indian, Asian, and Latin American history. </p><p></p></p><p>&#34;Very unusual and original. Guha presents a new set of conceptual categories to understand the peasant situation in the postcolonial era.

(Grace Shanahan, formerly with Brooklyn Public Libr <i>Library Journal</i> 2011-06-17)<br><br>Known as the "queen of herbs" in her country for both her knowledge and strong advocacy of these useful plants, British author and herb grower Jekka McVicar has compiled a list of fifty-one cooking herbs and plants. Fascinated by their versatility, she has collected and originated recipes in which each is a major ingredient because of its unique flavor. Described in a separate, delightfully illustrated chapter, each herb is reviewed in detail: general characteristics, culture, history in cooking, harvesting and uses (leaves, flowers, seeds, and roots), particular properties such as bitterness, and popular varieties. There are several recipes for each herb, each a gustatory treat, and their instructions are noted for their clarity. A useful glossary of botanical and medicinal information concludes the text. This book is highly recommended for its culinary and horticultural information. (<i>National Gardener</i>)<br><br>The Brits are still making beautiful books, thank goodness.

It examines events that profoundly shaped the Soviet political system that endured through most of the 20th century. Drawing largely from previously inaccessible Soviet archives, it demolishes standard interpretations of the origins of Soviet authoritarianism by demonstrating that the Soviet system evolved ad hoc as the Bolsheviks struggled to retain political power amid spiraling political, social, economic, and military crises. The book covers issues such as the rapid fall of influential moderate Bolsheviks, the formation of the dreaded Cheka, the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly, the Red Terror, the national government's flight to Moscow, and the subsequent rivalry between Russia's new and old capitals.</p></p><p>"An even more impressive and important work than the author's classic study of revolutionary 1917, <i>The Bolsheviks Come to Power</i>. In this book, Rabinowitch has culled an astonishing amount of new information from long closed archives and crafted it into a compelling narrative accessible to specialists and general readers alike.

In essence, it is a love story and a marvelously insightful account of their years together, beginning with their initial meeting when Fraser was the wife of a member of Parliament and mother of six, and Pinter was married to a distinguished actress. Over the years, they experienced much joy, a shared devotion to their work, crises and laughter, and, in the end, great courage and love as Pinter battled the illness to which he eventually sucï¿½cumbed on Christmas Eve 2008. <br><br><i>Must You Go? </i>is based on Fraser&#x2019;s recollections and on the diaries she has kept since October 1968. She shares Pinter&#x2019;s own revelations about his past, as well as observations by his friends. Fraser&#x2019;s diaries&#x2014;written by a biographer living with a creative artist and observing the process firsthand&#x2014;also proï¿½vide a unique insight into his writing. <br><br>Harold Pinter and Antonia Fraser lived together from August 1975 until his death thirty-three years later. &#x201c;O! call back yesterday, bid time return,&#x201d; cries one of the courtiers to Richard II. This is Antonia Fraser&#x2019;s uniquely compelling way of doing so.</p><p><b>ANTONIA FRASER </b>is the author of many internationï¿½ally bestselling historical works, including <i>Love and Louis XIV</i>, <i>Marie Antoinette</i>, which was made into a film by Sofia Coppola, <i>The Wives of Henry VIII</i>, <i>Mary Queen of Scots</i>, and <i>Faith and Treason: The Story of the Gunpowder Plot</i>. She has received the Wolfson Prize for History, the 2000 Norton Medlicott Medal of Britain&#x2019;s Historical Association, and the Franco-British Society&#x2019;s Enid McLeod Literary Prize.<i>Chapter One&nbsp;</i><br>&nbsp;<br>First Night <br><br>I first saw Harold across a crowded room, but it was lunchtime, not some enchanted evening, and we did not speak. I was having lunch in the Etoile restaurant in Charlotte Street; my companion pointed to a trio of men lunching opposite us. They were in fact Robert Shaw, Donald Pleasence and Harold; they were discussing Robert&#x2019;s play, <i>The Man in the Glass Booth</i>, in which Harold would direct Donald. My companion admired Robert Shaw intensely: the handsome red-headed star who was said to do his own stuntwork and embodied machismo. Apparently I said thoughtfully: &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll take the dark one.&#x2019; <br><br>On the next occasion I heard Harold&#x2019;s voice, once aptly described by Arthur Miller as his &#x2018;awesome baritone&#x2019;, before we met. There was a recital about Mary Queen of Scots at the National Portrait Gallery, based on my book. Harold&#x2019;s wife Vivien Merchant took the part of Mary, an actor took all the male parts and I read the narrative. These were professionals and I was intensely nervous; a kind friend in the audience told me afterwards that my knees were visibly shaking in my natty white trouser suit which had perhaps been the wrong call as a costume. Nevertheless things were running along smoothly &#x2013; Vivien was an accomplished reader who gave Mary the correct Scottish accent &#x2013; when suddenly there was some kind of interruption, a man&#x2019;s voice raised, at the back of the gallery. Afterwards I enquired rather crossly what had happened. &#x2018;Oh, that was Harold Pinter,&#x2019; I was told. &#x2018;He attacked the attendant for opening the door in the middle of the recital.&#x2019; &#x2018;I didn&#x2019;t hear the <i>door</i>,&#x2019; I muttered, having just learned that the projected LP of the recital would have to be abandoned due to the disturbance. Later, when I was introduced to Harold, I asked him if it had indeed been him. `Yes,' he replied with satisfaction, `I do that kind of thing all the time.' In similar situations in the future, I sometimes reflected wryly: `I can't say I wasn't warned . . .' <br><br>And so to the evening of 8 January 1975 when I went to the first night of <i>The Birthday Party </i>at the Shaw Theatre, directed by Kevin Billington, husband of my sister Rachel. The author was of course there and there was to be a dinner party afterwards at the Billingtons' house in Holland Park. <br><br>At this point, Hugh and I, Harold and Vivien, had both been married, oddly enough, for exactly the same period almost to the day: that is, eighteen years since September 1956 when Harold and Vivien got married in a Registry Office in Bournemouth (they were in rep there) while I dolled myself up as Mary Queen of Scots and Hugh wore a kilt at the Catholic Church in WarwickStreet, Soho, with a full sung Nuptial Mass. Hugh and I had six children; Harold and Vivien had one. Hugh had been a Conservative MP since 1945; Vivien was a celebrated actress. I was forty-two; Harold was forty-four. <br><br>I considered myself to be happily married, or at any rate happy in my marriage; I admired Hugh for his cavalier nature, his high spirits, his courage&nbsp;&#x2013; friends nicknamed him `Fearless Fraser' after some 1930s trapeze artist&nbsp;&#x2013; his independence, his essential decency and kindness. I even admired him for his detachment, although his lackof emotional intimacy&nbsp;&#x2013; he once told me that he preferred families to individuals&nbsp;&#x2013; was with hindsight probably what doomed us. I on the other hand was intensely romantic and always had been since early childhood; the trouble with romantics is that they tend to gravitate towards other like-minded people, or people they choose to regard as such. So there had been romances. But I had never for one moment envisaged leaving my marriage. <br><br>Harold, I learned much later, did not consider himself to be happily married. He too had had his romances, perhaps more than the world, which cast him as the dark, brooding, eponymously `Pinteresque' playï¿½wright, realized. Later he also told me that he had never been in love before, but had once loved Vivien very much, her essential vulnerability inspiring him with a wish to protect her, before other matters drove them apart. They led essentially separate lives in an enormous stately six-storey house in Regent's ParkTerrace; but he too had never conï¿½templated leaving his marriage. <br><i><br><br>8 January 1975 </i><br><br>A very enjoyable dinner party at Rachel and Kevin's house in Addison Avenue: a long and convivial table. I was slightly disappointed not to sit next to the playwright who looked full of energy, with black curly hair and pointed ears, like a satyr. Gradually the guests filtered away. My neighbours Richard and Viv King offered me a lift up the road. `Wait a minute,' I said. `I must just say goodbye to Harold Pinter and tell him I enjoyed the play; I haven't said hello all evening.' They waited at the door. I went over to where Harold was sitting. `Wonderful play, marvellous acting, now I'm off.' <br><br>He looked at me with those amazing, extremely bright black eyes. `Must you go?' he said. I thought of home, my lift, taking the children to school the next morning, the exhausting past night in the sleeper from Scotland, my projected biography of King Charles II . . . `No, it's not absolutely essential,' I said. <br><br>About 2.30 in the morning, poor Rachel and Kevin were visibly exhausted, and we were the last guests. In the end, it was Harold who gave me a lift home, in a white car with a driver (he never drove at night having once been found `weaving' in Regent's Park). I offered him coffee. I actually gave him champagne. He stayed until six o'clock in the morning with extraordinary recklessness, but of course the real recklessness was mine.&nbsp;<br><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><br>We sometimes speculated later what would have happened if I had in fact answered: `Yes, I really must go.' Harold, convinced by then that I was his destiny, would gallantly reply: `I would have found you someï¿½how.' But we had few friends in common: Edna O'Brien was one, and the producer Sam Spiegel another. But fundamentally we lived in different worlds. The night of 8/9 January was the chance and our chance. <br><br>Subsequently the tabloids made much of our different backgrounds, the working-class Jewish boy from the East End and the Catholic arisï¿½tocrat with her title. But we were, in our early forties, a long way from our backgrounds and, as usual with the tabloids, these descriptions were more for headlines than accuracy. Although Harold was technically born into the working class &#x2013; his father worked in a tailoring factory&nbsp;&#x2013; ever since the success of <i>The Caretaker </i>in 1960 he had been extremely well-off by most standards: he was able, for example, to retire his father, worn-out with his labours, to salubrious Hove where his parents would live happily for another thirty years. <br><br>Again technically, since my father was an earl and my mother a countess, I could be argued to be an aristocrat. But my father, born FrankPakenham, only succeeded to the Earldom of Longford when I was nearly thirty; my childhood was spent in a modest North Oxford house, my father, with no private income, teaching at the University. My mother, being a Harley Street doctor's daughter, was in any case convinced (and thus convinced us) that the middle classes were the salt of the earth whereas the aristocracy was feckless, unpunctual and extravagant, an assumption that our beloved father's attitude to life did nothing to discourage. I had no inherited money myself, and had earned my own living since the age of twenty-one, first working for a publisher and, after marriage, by journalism and books. <br><br>After the publication of Mar<i>y </i>Quee<i>n </i>o<i>f </i>Scots, an unexpected bestseller in 1969, I found that for the first time in my life I had money to spend. Most of it went on the delightful taskof renovating Eilean Aigas, our house in the Highlands on an island in the River Beauly, which gave the impression of being untouched since the '45 rebellion. Our finances had been so perilous before this, since Hugh was entirely dependent on the then modest salary of an MP, that he had actually sold the house to a cousin by the previous Christmas&nbsp;&#x2013; providentially the cousin's finances proved to be equally perilous and he reneged on the deal just in time for my windfall. To give only one example, I put in a heated open-air swimming pool round which the New Year celebrations regularly made the welkin ring. The truth was that by the mid 1970s, both in our different ways successful writers, Harold and I belonged to the same class: I will call it the Bohemian class. <br><i><br><br>13 January </i><br><br>While I was away, Harold had apparently called home on the public line; on Monday morning he called on my private line&nbsp;&#x2013; I'm not sure how he got the number. We met for a drinkat the Royal Lancaster Hotel in Bayswater (`an obscure place' he said truthfully) at 6 p.m. The bar was very darkand at first I couldn't see him. That made it all the more like a dream. But `so it <i>wasn't </i>all a dream' was the verdict of us both at the end. Told me of numerous obsessional phone calls&nbsp;&#x2013; no answer&nbsp;&#x2013; often from the famous Ladbroke Grove telephone box opposite Campden Hill Square. Had evidently told Kevin Billington about the <i>whole </i>thing! I began to guess this and he then admitted it. Can't say I care. `I am loopy about you: I feel eighteen' was the general theme; I said I preferred the word `dippy' . . . <br><br>The truth is that Harold has mesmerized me. Kept waking all night on the subject of a) him b) Benjie's departure for boarding school at Ampleforth. But a) has quite taken my mind off the horrible sadness of b). (Our third child and eldest son, aged not quite fourteen, was setting forth for his father's old school.) <br><i><br><br>23 January </i><br><br>Met Harold at 5.30 in the Royal Lancaster Hotel (he has telephoned daily). Parted at 11.30 to our respective matrimonial homes. We never left the bar, just talked and talked. Discussed among other things N<i>o </i>Man'<i>s </i>Land, his new play&nbsp;&#x2013; to open at the National in April&nbsp;&#x2013; and how he started to write it. At first he thought he was echoing himself (`What, two old men together agai<i>n </i>. . .'), then he thought: `You are what you are.' He had sent me the typescript after our first meeting. I liked the character of Spooner, the failed poet. So I asked him: `Did Spooner get the job?' On the whole he thought: No. `But Spooner is an optimist and there will be other jobs.' I said I would have to stop my ears at the first night for the darkof the ending: Winter/Night forever. But I liked `I'll drinkto that' at the end. `That's the point,' Harold said, delighted . . . I am quite obsessed by him when I am with him. He tells me he is quite obsessed by me all the time&nbsp;&#x2013; the days spent waiting to telephone, etc. . . . Described his life as a kind of prison, how, when can we meet, ever? <br><i><br><br>26 January </i><br><br>Taken to supper with Anthony Shaffer, author of <i>Sleuth</i>, by an old friend. The fashionable doctor for artists, PatrickWoodcock, warns me quite innocently against playwrights: `They're the worst.' Thought of Harold. I suppose I'm in love with him but there are many other things in my life. Yet: `oh, oh, the insomniac moonlight' in the words of the Scottish poet I like, Liz Lochhead. <br><i><br><br>30 January </i><br><br>Harold called. He asks: `Does it make you happy that we met? You wouldn't rather we hadn't met?' <br><i><br><br>1 February </i><br><br>I knew it would be a good day. Harold rang up in the morning and said, `Tea is on', having said two days ago `the situation is fluid'. Went at four, discreetly parking the car in Sussex Place. The house in Regent's ParkTerrace is vast, on first impression, and extremely sumptuous. I suppose it would not be so sumptuous if ten people lived in it. But with three, it is. A lot of large beautiful modern pictures in huge quiet rooms, apparently unlimited in number. Harold made tea. We went upstairs to the greeny-grey drawing room, vast pictures, few objects, greeny-grey light, enormous quantity of chairs and low sofas. <br><br>`I will show you my study presently.' And he did. At the top of the house, sixth floor in fact, we went up and up, like Tom Kitten. A marvellous room, much space, also less hushed. A deskwith windows overlooking Regent's Park and the other way, roofs. A chaise longue. A few chairs. Lots of books, novels and poetry. Harold presented me with his poems. `I would make a good secretary if you ever needed one,' I said, seeing the accommodation. He said: `the same thought had already crossed my mind.' <br><i><br><br>9 February </i><br><br>Joyous, dangerous and unavoidable&nbsp;&#x2013; Harold's three words to Kevin Billington about us, quoted by Harold to me on the telephone. Not bad Pinteresque words. <br><i><br><br>19 February </i><br><br>Period of crisis. On Sunday Harold called to say that Vivien was very ill (pneumonia) in Hong Kong, with the dreadful possibility of not being able to go on and film <i>Picnic at Hanging Rock </i>in Australia&nbsp;&#x2013; something she really wanted to do. He is racked with guilt. `Something of her own that I didn't write. That's what she wanted.' Much strain of cancellations and late-night calls.

However, when the poems arrived on the pale banana-coloured paper of the Peninsula Hotel, I protested about the comma after `me' which divided us and left him on the side of death and it was eliminated (although not put immediately after `death' as I wanted!).</p><h2>The Gay Science (the Joyful Wisdom) (Digireads.com Classic)</h2><p>First published in 1882 and revised in 1887, &#34;The Gay Science (The Joyful Wisdom)&#34; was written at the peak of Nietzsche&#39;s intellectual abilities. It includes a large number of poems and an appendix of songs, all written with the intent of encouraging freedom of the mind. While he praises the benefits of science, intellectual discipline, and skepticism, the influence of the Provenï¿½al tradition from which he drew is also an enthusiastic affirmation of life. Nietzsche additionally explores the notion of power and the idea of eternal recurrence, though not in a systematic way. Described by the philosopher himself as &#34;perhaps my most personal book,&#34; he produced a work that is worthy of attention from anyone with an interest in moral psychology or the most essential themes and views of Nietzsche.</p><p>Nietzsche wrote The Gay Science, which he later described as &#39;perhaps my most personal book&#39;, when he was at the height of his intellectual powers, and the reader will find in it an extensive and sophisticated treatment of the philosophical themes and views most central to Nietzsche&#39;s own thought and most influential on later thinkers. This volume presents the work in a new translation by Josefine Nauckhoff, with an introduction by Bernard Williams that elucidates the work&#39;s main themes and discusses their continuing importance.Nietzsche called The Gay Science "the most personal of all my books." It was here that he first proclaimed the death of God -- to which a large part of the book is devoted -- and his doctrine of the eternal recurrence. <br>Walter Kaufmann's commentary, with its many quotations from previously untranslated letters, brings to life Nietzsche as a human being and illuminates his philosophy. The book contains some of Nietzsche's most sustained discussions of art and morality, knowledge and truth, the intellectual conscience and the origin of logic. <br>Most of the book was written just before Thus Spoke Zarathustra, the last part five years later, after Beyond Good and Evil. We encounter Zarathustra in these pages as well as many of Nietzsche's most interesting philosophical ideas and the largest collection of his own poetry that he himself ever published. <br>Walter Kaufmann's English versions of Nietzsche represent one of the major translation enterprises of our time. He is the first philosopher to have translated Nietzsche's major works, and never before has a single translator given us so much of Nietzsche.</p><h2>The Art Of The Engineer</h2><p><p><strong>Engineering drawing, though it had its roots in scientific and technical illustration at the time of the Renaissance and in architectural and naval draughtsmanship in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, was essentially a product of the Industrial Revolution.</strong></p> The numerous drawings reproduced in this book offer a representative selection of the work produced for the transport industries - ships, railway engines, motor-cars, aeroplanes - during the past two hundred years. Many are superb examples of draughtsmanship, and a number are equal in quality to the best drawings of any kind. The illustrations can be looked at in two complementary ways. The drawings may be enjoyed for their visual quality alone, but it is also important to grasp their significance for the design and production processes to which they relate. As all the drawings were originally produced for a specific purpose, their place in the story of engineering needs to be understood. In their text and detailed captions, the authors place each drawing in its context and describe the development of the skills of draughtsmanship as they interacted with the entrepreneurial demands of rapidly developing technology. The book as a whole therefore makes an important contribution to the history of technology, as well as providing outstanding examples of the richness of the visual resources that emanated from the Industrial Revolution. This is an impressive work of scholarship that draws not just on the extensive collections of engineering drawings that exist in Britain (where the Industrial Revolution had its beginnings), but also from American and European sources. Drawings normally unseen and often unknown outside a small circle of specialists are now presented to a wider public.</p><p></p><h2>Jim, Who Ran Away from His Nurse, and Was Eaten by a Lion</h2><p>A treat for fans of ghastly gore and egregious endings.<br> <br>&#x201c;Contains a Dangerous Beast and a Miserable End,&#x201d; states a warning on the cover. But if you are strong of heart and like your humor a little on the dark side, jump right into the brilliant collaboration of the Edwardian humorist Hilaire Belloc, dead for the past 57 years, and the very much alive Mini Grey. Grey's sly illustrations, clever type designs, amazing lift-the-flaps, and a roaring lion pop-up, not to mention her zoo map with hilarious Rules and Byelaws, make this edition of the classic cautionary tale a collectible to savor. Decidedly not a lift-the-flap for babies, it will lift the spirits of anyone with a well-developed sense of humor.</p><p>Mini Grey is the author-artist of the <i>Boston Globe&#x2013;Horn Book</i> Award&#x2013;winning picture book <i>Traction Man Is Here!</i> and its sequel, <i>Traction Man Meets Turbodog.</i> The books received five and six starred reviews, respectively. Her quirky, off-the-wall humor can also be seen in <i>The Adventures of the Dish and the Spoon,</i> <i>The Very Smart Pea and the Princess to Be,</i> <i>Ginger Bear,</i> and <i>Egg Drop.</i><br> <br>Hilaire Belloc (1870&#x2013;1953) wrote the now-classic cautionary tale <i>Jim</i> in 1907. It was written as a satirical response to the didactic morality tales popular for children in Victorian times and was intended as much for adults as children. He lived and died in England.Gr 3-5&#x2013;In this parody of a cautionary tale, a lion eats disobedient young Jim. While the text states that Jim's &#x201c;Friends were very good to him,&#x201d; the mixed-media illustrations show otherwise, as the adults who care for the boy overfeed him to the point of illness, give him a tricycle too small for him, and subject him to boring read-alouds. No wonder &#x201c;Jim slipped his hand and ran away&#x201d; while his nurse flirted with a man at the zoo. The moral? &#x201c;...always keep a-hold of Nurse/For fear of finding something WORSE.&#x201d; Wryly humorous, cartoon illustrations with foldout pages, flaps, and a pop-up lion extend the sarcastic text. Some adults may object to the depiction of Jim's decapitated head and the bloody &#x201c;Dainty Morsel&#x201d; in the lion's mouth, but kids with an ironic sense of humor who are beginning to question adult authority will likely eat this story up.<i>Julie R.

You will have envisioned, Tom Lewis tells us, the amount of earth moved and the amount of concrete poured to make America's interstate highway system, a network of roads planned far back in the 19th century but completed only a few years ago. The public's view of the interstate system, Lewis writes, has been colored in recent decades by the grim realities of gridlock, smog, and road rage. In their early years, however, these highways seemed to promise the freedom of the open road, a gateway to faraway coasts. Lewis does a fine job of conveying the grandeur of the project, the largest work of civil construction ever undertaken by a democratic power.<p> Lewis's narrative is peopled with largely unknown figures, among them the little-heralded but critically important engineer Harris MacDonald. MacDonald turned the federal Bureau of Public Roads into a powerful force of social as well as physical engineering and paved the way for the large-scale projects of the Roosevelt and Eisenhower administrations. Lewis, a well-traveled explorer on the byways of technological progress, extends his history well into the past. He describes the building of the first national and post roads, the great parkways that connected such far-flung cities as Winnipeg and Miami, the once rural roads that, over the decades, blossomed into multilane highways--a process that has always depended on what Lewis calls "Americans' faith in technocracy" and their will to shape the future, acre by acre. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Tom Lewis is a professor of English at Skidmore College and an active documentary filmmaker.

As a former atheist, Strobel understands the rational resistance to faith. He even names the eight most convincing arguments against Christian faith: <blockquote> 1) If there's a loving God, why does this pain-wracked world groan under so much suffering and evil?<br> 2) If the miracles of God contradict science, then how can any rational person believe that they're true?<br> 3) If God is morally pure, how can he sanction the slaughter of innocent children as the Old Testament says he did?<br> 4) If God cares about the people he created, how could he consign so many of them to an eternity of torture in hell just because they didn't believe the right things about him?<br> 5) If Jesus is the only way to heaven, then what about the millions of people who have never heard of him?<br> 6) If God really created the universe, why does the evidence of science compel so many to conclude that the unguided process of evolution accounts for life?<br> 7) If God is the ultimate overseer of the church, why has it been rife with hypocrisy and brutality throughout the ages?<br> 8) If I'm still plagued by doubts, then is it still possible to be a Christian?<br> </blockquote> These are mighty tough questions, and Strobel fields them well. Rather than write a weighty dissertation about the merits of faith, he brings us along on his quest as we meet leaders in the Christian community, such as Peter Kreeft and William Lane Craig. We also encounter his everyday friends and acquaintances that serendipitously fill in the holes in each of the eight arguments against faith. The use of dialogue from personal interviews and a scene-by-scene active narrative makes this an easy and engaging read. However, easy does not mean breezy. This is a book of substance and merit, one that will help Christians defend their faith, especially during the hardest of times, when they have to defend their faith to themselves in moments of doubt. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>Lee Strobel, with a Master of Studies in Law degree from Yale, was an award-winning journalist for 13 years at the Chicago Tribune and other newspapers.

He looked around, appreciating the beauty of the well-pruned shrubs, the brilliant flowers, and the brick paths that led to a gazebo at the far end of the grounds. All thanks to his acting skills and his brother's wise investment strategies. He picked a delicate, crimson flower, his fingers caressing its silky petals. He shouldn't have picked it. It would die soon. He wished he had left it on the bush. He hurried into the house and stuck it into a glass of water.<br><br>The house was state-of-the-art, befitting his star power in the movie industry. At forty-three, he was in top form. With two mini face-lifts under his belt, he could still hold his own with the young studs arriving in Hollywood in droves. He had a tinge of gray at his temples these days, but the studio expertly covered it up. He still had the same dark brown bedroom eyes, the same lean muscular body that had helped make him famous. He was still a hunk.<br><br><i>Variety</i> said he was still the Platinum Boy. They said he had it all. If they only knew. He was probably the loneliest man in all of California. He had one close friend, his stuntman, Ted Lymen. And, of course, Philly. He could never discount Philly. He was where he was today because of his brother. But Philly was not his friend. Philly wasn't even his mentor. Philly was his warden.<br><br>His relationship with Philly had never been the same after he'd returned from the exclusive addiction clinic fifteen years earlier. Instead of treating him as a brother, Philly had reduced their relationship to that of business manager and client, sometimes even warden and prisoner. Oh, they still met for dinner once or twice a year, usually at some out-of-the-way restaurant. Conversation was always strained as Philly smoked and drank, and Ricky did neither. They still went to an occasional ball game together, and Philly even came on the set and watched him work when he was in town. But it wasn't the same. It would never be the same again, and they both knew it. It was an accept-it-or-reject-it relationship. Ricky chose to accept it.<br><br>No matter what he did, no matter what he said, he hadn't been able to recapture the old relationship. Secretly, he thought Philly was waiting for him to screw up. And, like the stupid ass he was, Ricky wouldn't give him the satisfaction. He never wanted to see that look of disgust in his brother's face again. Never, ever.<br><br>In the beginning, when he had first returned from the clinic, Ricky had blamed Roxy because he needed someone to blame. Fifteen years later, he laid the blame right where it belonged, on his own shoulders.<br><br>In the dark, late at night, when no one was around, he prayed that Philly would forgive him and throw his arms around his shoulders, and say, "Let's let bygones be bygones." It hadn't happened, and it wasn't going to happen. He knew that now. Fifteen years of being a straight arrow wasn't enough to satisfy Philly.<br><br>Ricky flopped down on a custom-crafted chair in the living room, his favorite, and picked up a script. It was untitled. <i>What kind of scriptwriter doesn't give his work a title?</i> He was supposed to read it, decide if it was worthy of his talent, then let his agent and the front office know if he was willing to negotiate. He tossed the script back onto the table.<br><br>Tomorrow was the final wrap for the movie he was working on, <i>Seven Hours Till Sundown</i>. An hour at the most, maybe two, depending on how many takes the director wanted. The wrap party was tonight, though, because once they wound up the film tomorrow, the crew was heading off to Washington, D.C., to start a new film titled <i>Inside the Beltway</i>. It was all about a politician's rage on the Beltway. He was glad he had passed on that piece of crap.<br><br>Ricky looked at the phone on the table next to him, willing it to ring. Philly was in town for the wrap party and to cart his check off to the bank, at which point he would head back to the islands to manage their two resorts.<br><br>Resorts for the rich and famous. All you needed to visit one of them was a bucketful of money and a reservation made two years in advance. It had been Philly's idea to build the resorts, pointing out that Ricky wasn't going to be able to work in Hollywood forever. Leading men had a tendency to get old, and after a while face-lifts left you looking haggard. "You need something to fall back on when that happens, Ricky," Philly had said. "You'll never be happy playing character parts. Get out when you're on top and hobnob with the new elite where you call the shots." It had made sense. As long as he didn't allow himself to get pissed off at his brother's financial prowess, Ricky realized that everything his older brother said made sense.<br><br>He looked down at the phone. He supposed he could initiate the call, but to what end? Ricky had never stepped over the boundaries Philly had erected when Ricky had returned from the clinic. Why start now?<br><br>He, too, was heading for the islands after the last shoot tomorrow. Thirty days of doing nothing but relaxing in his very own star suite. Philly hated it when he showed up at the resort. Ricky wasn't sure why. The attention he got from the staff? Roxy's strange attitude toward him even though he stayed out of her way?<br><br>Ricky continued to stare at the phone. Christ, how he hated tiptoeing around his brother.<br><br>He bounded off the chair and loped over to the mantel to pick up two small pictures. His sons. Children he provided for but had never seen. No, that wasn't true, he had seen them once.<br><br>It was one of two demands he'd made when he'd signed off on the deals Philly had negotiated with the boys' mothers, young girls he'd had one-night stands with during that wild time in his youth when he was Hollywood's number one hell-raiser. "Try explaining that to your studio and all those young adoring fans," Philly had said.<br><br>In exchange for signing a confidentiality agreement, each girl received the princely sum of ten grand a month until her son finished college and the assurance that Ricky would never attempt to interfere in her son's life. One breach on her part and the money stopped cold. Philly had used the word <i>lawsuit</i> a lot when he'd talked to the frightened girls. Even to this day, both women honored the agreements. Ricky recalled the excitement he'd felt when he'd laid eyes on his sons for the first time. They'd been three then, little blond-haired boys all dressed up and hating every minute of it. They'd looked at him suspiciously and hung on to their mothers' skirts. He'd just stared at them, committing their faces to memory. It was all he could do.<br><br>The boys, born three months apart, were twenty-three now and had never met each other. In fact, neither of them knew he had a half brother. Tyler had lived with his maternal grandparents until he'd left for college because his mother was off singing with a country western band. Max had also lived with his grandparents after his mother married a real estate developer because he didn't get along with her husband. Both boys had finished college and were working. He'd been tempted to call them, invite them to Hollywood, but Philly had made him swear not to seek them out, saying he should let sleeping dogs lie. "And don't try to do it on the sly, either, Ricky, because you'll be recognized, and I'm not pulling any more of your chestnuts out of the fire." That had been the end of that, which didn't say much for him as a father. It was always Philly's way or the highway.<br><br>He wondered what his sons would think of him as a person if they knew he was their father. Anonymously, he'd bought the boys their first cars, paid for their college educations and all medical and dental bills. They had both gone to exclusive summer camps and attended the best private schools in their areas. At least that's what Philly told him. Most of what Philly had told him about Tyler was a lie, according to the private detective he'd hired to report on his sons. A report he'd never showed Philly. Tyler had been booted out of the prestigious summer camps, usually three days after arrival. Incorrigible, the counselors said. He'd been suspended eight times while in high school and how he'd graduated was still a mystery. What was even more of a mystery was how he'd gotten into college and managed to graduate in the lowest percentile in the class. But he had graduated. Add up all the arrest charges for speeding while under the influence, loss of driving privileges, and his bad-ass attitude, car wrecks, drug experimentation, and he could have posed for a portrait of his father in his early twenties. A chip off the old block.<br><br>Max, on the other hand, could have posed as the poster boy for good behavior.<br><br>Ricky stared down at the two golden-haired boys. Three years old. That was how long it had taken to settle everything. His second demand before he'd signed off on the deal was a picture of each boy before he walked away from the six-hundred-dollar-an-hour lawyer's office. The pictures arrived two weeks later in the mail. He set both pictures back on the mantel.<br><br>Right now, Ricky thought his life really sucked. The phone still hadn't rung. "Screw it!" he said as he stomped his way back to the master suite of rooms where he hid out most of the time. Big Hollywood star a homebody. It was so damn funny he wanted to cry.<br><br>Ricky looked down at the phone he knew resembled something in the White House War Room. It was hooked up to the alarm system, the security gates, the intercom, and the doorbell. It had nineteen buttons he could press if he felt like it. He still didn't know how to work the damn thing. The doorbell was the funniest thing of all. No one could access his property without going past the part-time security guard, who had to open the security gates. How was someone supposed to ring his doorbell if they couldn't get to the door?<br><br>The phone rang. Ricky sucked in his breath before he picked it up. His greeting sounded cautious. It paid to be cautious with Philly. "Hello."<br><br>It was Ted Lymen, his stuntman. "Yo, Ricky, just calling to ask if you changed your mind about going to the wrap party. You wanna go, I'll stop by and pick you up. I just got a call saying they canceled the stunt for tomorrow. We're in a holding pattern until they get a part for the race car. Probably the day after tomorrow. So, do you want to go or not?"<br><br>Cancellation meant he didn't have to get up at four-thirty to be at the studio for makeup at five. Did he want to go? Did he want to stand around making nice so Philly wouldn't chew his ass out? "Yeah, sure," was his response. "What time?"<br><br>"Eight. Let's do the town afterward. Let's take in the Ozone Club and do a little partying. We both deserve a night out, Ricky. This flick kicked both our asses big-time."<br><br>"Sure." What the hell, it would beat sitting around with Philly praying to God he didn't say the wrong thing or make a mistake. "Philly's in town, you know."<br><br>"Yeah. Yeah, I heard. So you make nice for ten minutes, and we split. I wish to hell you'd get over that inferiority thing you have with your brother. He's what he is because of you, and don't you ever forget it. Without your money, he'd be working in some cubicle managing other people's money. Go easy on yourself, okay?"<br><br>"Okay, I will. I'll see you at eight."<br><br>As he hung up Ricky wondered if everyone thought he was a wuss where his brother was concerned.<br><br>The minute the gates to Ricky's estate closed behind Ted's Jaguar, the phone inside the mansion rang. The caller left a message. "The part for the car just arrived. The shoot's back on. Be at the studio by five-thirty tomorrow morning." The same message was left at Ted Lymen's home.<br><br>The wrap party was like every other one Ricky had attended. Food, liquor, flowers, the women teary-eyed, the guys looking macho as they tried not to worry about whether there was another movie down the road. They all promised to stay in touch knowing full well they wouldn't, unless somehow, some way, they needed a favor and they had your personal unlisted telephone number. In Hollywood, like almost everywhere else, it wasn't what you knew, it was who you knew.<br><br>"How are you, Philly?" Ricky said, slapping his brother lightly on the back in a friendly gesture.<br><br>"Good. Real good. You're looking fit, little brother. I hear you're coming down to the islands."<br><br>"I'm in the thinking stages," Ricky lied. He'd picked up his airline tickets yesterday. "Enjoy yourself," Ricky said, preparing to walk away.<br><br>"Didn't you forget something, Ricky?"<br><br>Ricky turned and faced his brother. "No, I didn't forget. I just wanted to make you <i>ask</i> for it." He reached inside his jacket pocket and withdrew an envelope that he literally slapped into his brother's hand. Seeing the sudden look of embarrassment on Philly's face was worth all the angst he'd gone through that day. This time he did walk away.<br><br>"Damn, that felt good," he said to Ted.<br><br>"How in hell can handing over fifteen million bucks to your brother make you feel good?"<br><br>"I made him ask for it, and I stared him down at the same time. I never did that before. Don't ask me why I had to do it today of all days because I don't know."<br><br>"Oh."<br><br>"Yeah, oh. You said something about partying..."<br><br>"I did, didn't I?"<br><br>Philip Lam watched his brother walk away. He felt a sudden urge to run after him and give him a big bear hug. He squelched the desire. One soft move on his part, and Ricky would go back to square one. He raised his eyes upward. "I'm doing my best, Mom," he murmured.<br><br>Ricky Lam woke, his head pounding. He remembered instantly that he had fallen off the wagon last night to the tune of at least four bottles of champagne. His eyes wild, he looked around to see if anyone was sharing his bed. His sigh of relief when he saw that he was alone was so loud that Ellie, his housekeeper, probably heard it in the kitchen.<br><br>He deserved the misery he was feeling. What in the name of God had possessed him to start drinking after fifteen years of sobriety? Philly was the answer. Thank the Lord he didn't have to report to the studio. He'd never make it even if it was just a walkaway part for him. He scrunched his eyes to look at the clock: 6:30. He rolled over with the intention of sleeping all day so the headache banging inside his skull would go away.<br><br>The phone rang. No one called him at six-thirty in the morning except Philly, who was also known to call him at five-thirty, four-thirty, midnight, and any damn time he felt like it. The studio also called whenever they felt like it. <i>Should I answer it or shouldn't I? The hell with it.</i> The phone kept ringing. The sound was killing his head. He finally picked it up.<br><br>"Ricky," Ted said urgently, "the studio called last night and left a message. The shoot's on. Get your ass in gear, and I'll pick you up in ten minutes."<br><br>"Shit!"<br><br>"Yeah, shit! Be by the gates, and we'll do a wheelie and get over there in nothing flat."<br><br>Ricky made it with a minute to spare. "You're in no condition to drive that race car this morning, Ted. Are you crazy?"<br><br>"Probably. However, I don't have a hangover like you do. I ate my breakfast. I also slept four hours. I'm good to go. Did you check your messages?"<br><br>"No," Ricky groaned. "Listen, Philly's going to be on the lot. Let's not say anything about last night, okay? I'll go to AA and confess my relapse. I'll go to Makeup before I see him."<br><br>Ted nodded. "I was thinking this morning in the shower...</p><h2>Flowers of the World</h2><p>older edition hard back edge wear</p><p></p><h2>Paella</h2><p>Presents over a hundred recipes for paella, including regional variations and recipes for paellas on the stove and on the barbeque, paellas without rice, and sweet paellas.</p><p>Alberto Herraiz was born in Castilla la Mancha, Spain, into a family of four generations of restaurateurs.

Leve and Morgan detail how, for the first time in history, youth became a commercial and cultural force with the power to command the attention of government and religion and shape society.</p><p>While the Cold War began to thaw, the race into space heated up, feminism and civil rights percolated in politics, and JFK&#x2019;s assassination shocked the world, the Beatles and Bob Dylan would emerge as poster boys and the prophet of a revolution that changed the world.</p><p><em>1963: The Year of the Revolution</em> records, documentary-style, the incredible roller-coaster ride of those twelve months, told through the recollections of some of the period&#x2019;s most influential figures&#x2014;from Keith Richards to Mary Quant, Vidal Sassoon to Graham Nash, Alan Parker to Peter Frampton, Eric Clapton to Gay Talese, Stevie Nicks to Norma Kamali, and many more.</p><p></p></p><p><p>1963</p><p>It was the year that Cold War protagonists sought a truce, the race to space stepped up a gear, feminism and civil rights flexed their political muscles, and President John F. Kennedy's assassination numbed the world. But as the front pages of history were being printed, the scoop of the century slipped by unnoticed. On January 13, 1963, two then-largely unknown musical acts made their first appearances on nationwide television in Britain. Neither the Beatles nor Bob Dylan could have known it at the time, but through some strange alchemy the anthems of social upheaval were being heard by a mass audience&#x2014;and these artists were the catalyst. Within the year, their voices were captivating millions of ears around the world. The Beatles had become the poster boys of a revolution that still influences us to this day, and Dylan its prophet.</p><p>In short, 1963 saw the birth of a global demographic power shift. Within that one year, youth, for the first time in history, had become a commercial and cultural force that commanded the attention of government and religion and exercised the power to shape society.</p><p><em>1963: The Year of the Revolution</em> is the first book to recount the kinetic story of the liberation of youth through music, fashion, and the arts&#x2014;and in the voices of those who changed the world so radically, from Keith Richards to Eric Clapton, Mary Quant to Vidal Sassoon, Graham Nash to Peter Frampton, Alan Parker to Gay Talese, Stevie Nicks to Norma Kamali, and many more. It is an oral history that records, documentary-style, the incredible roller-coaster ride of that year, in which a group of otherwise obscure teenagers would become global superstars.

Coomaraswamy, curator of Indian art at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, uniquely combined the roles of art historian, philosopher, orientalist, linguist, and expositor. His knowledge of the arts and handcrafts of the Orient was unsurpassed, and his numerous monographs on Oriental art either established, or revolutionized, entire fields. Coomaraswamy was one of the foremost Orientalists of his time, with an almost unmatched understanding of traditional culture. He mastered the philosophic and religious terrain of the entire premodern world, East and West; and for him primitive, medieval European, and classical Indian experiences of truth and art were only different dialects of a common language.</p><h2>Samuel Pepys: Plague, Fire, Revolution</h2><p><p><strong>The life, career, and world of Samuel Pepys, lavishly illustrated and published to coincide with an exhibition at the National Maritime Museum</strong></p> Samuel Pepys (1633&#x2013;1703) lived through one of the most exciting and troubled periods in English history.

She traveled in Europe throughout 1921-22 as a "foreign correspondent" for <i>Vanity Fair.</i> Her collection <i>A Few Figs from Thistles</i> (1920) gained her a reputation for hedonistic wit and cynicism, but her other collections (including the earlier <i>Renascence and Other Poems</i> [1917]) are without exception more seriously passionate or reflective. </p><p>In 1923 she married Eugene Boissevain and -- after further travel -- embarked on a series of reading tours which helped to consolidate her nationwide renown. From 1925 onwards she lived at Steepletop, a farmstead in Austerlitz, New York, where her husband protected her from all responsibilities except her creative work. Often involved in feminist or political causes (including the Sacco-Vanzetti case of 1927), she turned to writing anti-fascist propaganda poetry in 1940 and further damaged a reputation already in decline. In her last years of her life she became more withdrawn and isolated, and her health, which had never been robust, became increasingly poor. </p><p>She died in 1950.</p>"She wrote some of the best sonnets of the century." -- <i>-- Richard Eberhart</i><br><br><p>"I know that Millay is a good poet because there are so many of her lines in my memory. She belonged to a generation which thought of poetry as song; when that notion revives, as it will, the great appeal of her work will be felt again." -- <i>Richard Wilbur</i><br><br></p><p>"One of the only poets writing in English in our time who have attained anything like the stature of great literary figures." -- <i>Edmund Wilson</i><br><br></p><p>"She wrote some of the best sonnets of the century." -- <i>Richard Eberhart</i><br><br></p><p>"There are some who delight and inform. It's so much better, you see, for me, when a writer like Edna St. Vincent Millay speaks so deeply about her concern for herself, and does not offer us any altruisms. Then when I look through her eyes at how she sees a black or an Asian my heart is lightened." -- <i>Maya Angelou</i></p></p><h2>First Day On The Somme 1 July 1916</h2><p>Martin Middlebrook's The First Day on the Somme is a compelling and intensely moving account of the blackest day in the history of the British army. On 1 July, 1916, a continuous line of British soldiers climbed out from the trenches of the Somme into No Man's Land and began to walk slowly towards dug-in German troops armed with machine-guns and defended by thick barbed wire. By the end of that day, as old tactics were met by the reality of modern warfare, there had been more than 60,000 British casualties - a third of them fatalities. As well as drawing on official sources, local newspapers, autobiographies, novels and poems from the time, most importantly The First Day on the Somme also takes in the accounts of hundreds of survivors: normal men, many of them volunteers, who found themselves thrown into a scene of unparalleled tragedy and horror. The First Day on the Somme describes the true events behind one of the largest battles of the First World War, and the sacrifice of a generation of young men - killed as much by the folly of their commanders as by the bullets of their enemies.

He died in St. Louis in 2009.</p>What is the connection between a psychotic woman carrying a trombone case for most unmusical purposes through the streets of Moscow and the theft of the deputy procurator's much-prized automobile? How does the slaying of a young policeman by a sniper relate to the murder of aged Abraham as he reads Izvestia in the bathtub, by intruders who steal a worthless brass candlestick on their way out? And why is it that Abraham's crippled daughter Sofiya is driven by ambivalent feelings toward her dead father? These are among the conundrums confronting Inspector Porfiry Rostnikov of the Moscow Procurator's Office as he trudges painfully through his rounds (like Sofiya, he has a game leg), teasing humorless underlings, sparring with members of the KGB, squinting jaundice-eyed into the cobwebbed corners of the political establishment, where no light shines. Despite a certain ungainliness in scenes of action, the narrative moves easily to an unhappily credible, ironic conclusion. And Rostnitkov, his hopes of emigration with his Jewish wife dashed, faces yet another professional setback with stoic resignation. Following Black Knight in Red Square, this is the fourth novel in a series featuring the appealing, amiable, sore-beset Inspector. n.b.

He lives in London.</p><b>The Chalice of Blood</b><br><b>CHAPTER ONE</b>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>A</b>lthough it was not yet the end of summer, there was a damp chill in the air and Abbot Iarnla drew his chair nearer to the smoky log fire. No warmth emanated from it, only grey fumes and the hissing of moisture. He exhaled in annoyance.'The wood is damp, Brother Gï¿½eth,' he admonished the moon-faced religieux whose task it was to bring the wood to provide warmth for the abbot's chamber.'Forgive me, Father Abbot,' the man stammered. 'It has only just been noticed that the thatch on the woodshed roof was in need of repair. The rain must have came through and soaked into the wood and--'Abbot Iarnla made a cutting motion with his left hand. '<i>Mox nox in rem</i>,' he snapped impatiently, 'soon night, to the business. ' The wood-bearer received this sharp reproof with a bowed head and muttered that he would go at once in search of dry logs to replace the wet ones. Brother Gï¿½eth was a tall man with almost ugly features and a permanently crestfallen expression that made the elderly abbot immediately feel guilty that he had spoken so roughly. It was known that Brother Gï¿½eth was not considered robust in mind and his Latin was limited. The abbot forced a sympathetic smile. 'If you can find dry wood, bringit quickly, for I feel a chill.' Brother Gï¿½eth moved obediently towards the door.When he opened it, he found a tall man with thin, almost gaunt features and pale blue eyes on the threshold, his hand raised as if he were about to knock. Brother Gï¿½eth stood quickly aside, head bowed respectfully, for Brother Lugna was the <i>rechtaire</i>, the steward, of the abbey of Lios Mï¿½r, and second in authority to the abbot.Abbot Iarnla had heard Brother Gï¿½eth's soft intake of breath and glanced round to see why he had paused before leaving.'Ah, come in, Brother Lugna,' he invited, and motioned to a seat facing him on the far side of the fireplace. 'I wanted a word with you.'Brother Lugna was in his mid-thirties; his long, straw-coloured hair was worn with the <i>corona spina</i> tonsure of Rome, which marked him out as one who followed Roman Rule, unlike his abbot who maintained the tonsure of St John, favoured by the Irish clerics. Brother Lugna's features seemed frozen in a disapproving expression. He entered and closed the door behind the wood-bearer. Then he crossed to the chair indicated by the abbot, lowered himself into it and sat without speaking.Abbot Iarnla was elderly, with silver hair and mournful brown eyes and a figure that indicated a man who had been used to an easy and indolent way of life. He gestured towards the smoking fire.'The wood is wet,' he explained unnecessarily. There was almost petulance in his voice.His steward nodded absently. 'I have already reprimanded our <i>tugatï¿½ir</i>, the thatcher, for letting the woodshed roof fall into disrepair.' His tone indicated that his thoughts were elsewhere. 'He should have known better than to instruct Brother Gï¿½eth to bring wet wood to you.'The abbot glanced at him thoughtfully. 'I asked you to come,Brother Lugna, because I hear that you are still concerned with the well-being of Brother Donnchad. Or is it the Venerable Brï¿½en who troubles you? I hear that in the <i>refectorium</i> this morning he announced that he had seen an angel at his window last evening.'Brother Lugna's mouth drooped further. 'The Venerable Brï¿½en is old and sadly his mind wanders. But it is Brother Donnchad who is of more concern to the community and me.''Such journeys and adventures that have fallen to the lot of Brother Donnchad can leave a marked affect upon the strongest of men,' the abbot commented.Brother Lugna pursed his thin lips before replying. 'The community is worried for him. I am worried for him. I am told that even before he set out for the Holy Land with Brother Cathal, he was of an introspective nature and prone to moods, spending long hours in lonely contemplation.''Surely that is in the spiritual nature of our calling. Why, therefore, be concerned that he displays such tendencies now?' countered the abbot with a wry smile.'I have every respect for Brother Donnchad's commitment to the Faith and to his scholarship. Nevertheless, his moods cause concern. He has sunk into gloomy contemplation ever since he returned from the Holy Land. Indeed, at times he often displays peevishness with his fellows, especially with Brother Gï¿½eth who, I understand, was once his <i>anam chara</i> - his soul friend.' He grimaced and added, 'I always thought Brother Gï¿½eth a curious choice as a soul friend for a scholar of Brother Donnchad's reputation. But I am told that his current attitude to Brother Gï¿½eth is out of tune with his earlier disposition towards him.'Abbot Iarnla sat back in his chair and clasped his hands together, leaving both forefingers extended and touching at the tips, which he placed against his lips.'I am reminded that you joined our community just a shorttime after Donnchad and Cathal set out on their pilgrimage. A pity that you did not know them at that time. Things were very different then.' He paused and sighed. 'Let us consider the facts. In a way, Donnchad has lost his blood brother as well as his brother in Christ. I remember when Donnchad and Cathal first came to join us at this abbey. They were local youths from the fortress by the ford, just a few kilometres downriver from here.''I am well acquainted with their story, being, as you know, under the patronage of their mother, Lady Eithne of An Dï¿½n,' the steward responded in a flat voice.'I had not forgotten. She is a most devout lady. Not only is she a staunch supporter of the Faith but has always been a supporter of our community.' Abbot Iarnla refused to be distracted from his reminiscence. 'Her sons, Cathal and Donnchad, were highly intelligent lads and Brother Cathal became one of our best teachers. Alas, it was his very learning that almost became his downfall. Maolochtair, the Prince of the Dï¿½isi, who governed the lands this abbey was built on, became jealous of his knowledge and denounced Cathal to the King at Cashel. He claimed Cathal was indulging in magical practices.''I have heard the tale and know that Maolochtair was old and twisted by that time,' interposed Brother Lugna.'He was indeed. But who would dare say it? It was he who instructed Lady Eithne's husband to give this land to our founder, the Blessed Carthach, over thirty years ago, so that he could build this abbey upon it. We had to respect Maolochtair, although, to be frank, his mind was not what it once was. He was filled with suspicion against family and friend alike, thinking they all meant him harm. We tried to send Brother Cathal out of harm's way to administer the church and community at Sean Raithï¿½n, the old fortress in the mountains north of here. But Maolochtair soon followed him there with his accusations.'Maolochtair demanded that the King at Cashel imprison Cathal for a while in order that the grave charges could be considered. The King felt bound to agree, for Maolochtair was kin through his marriage to the aunt of his own father, Failbe Flann. Thanks to the King's sister, Sister Fidelma, Cathal was cleared. I believe it was her advice that not only secured his release but sent him and his brother, Donnchad, out of the vengeful reach of Maolochtair until that twisted man departed this earthly realm.''I know,' Brother Lugna replied, showing his irritation. 'I have heard the story from the Lady Eithne's own lips. Five years ago Cathal and his brother Donnchad agreed to set out on their pilgrimage to the Holy Land. A short time after they left, Maolochtair died from the <i>delirium tremens</i>.''Our beloved brethren succeeded in reaching the Holy Land. Ah, what joy it must have been to behold Jerusalem and walk the roads where our Lord once walked.' The abbot was smiling, seemingly lost in the pleasure of contemplating such an achievement.'Except that the joy was not long-lived,' Brother Lugna pointed out. 'On the return journey, they were shipwrecked off the southern coast of Italy.''But our brethren survived,' the abbot responded.'Survived? Indeed they were among the few who made it to the shore when their ship was wrecked. But many others, including the crew of the ship, all perished in the turbulent waves.''Cathal was so welcomed by the people of the city where they were brought ashore ... what was the name of it? Tarentum? Ah yes, that's it. Tarentum. He was so welcomed that he decided to settle there. And the people immediately elevated him to be the bishop of that city.'Brother Lugna sniffed slightly. 'Their gain was our loss and, indeed, a loss to his own brother as well as to his mother, theLady Eithne, who still mourns him as one dead. At least Brother Donnchad felt it was his obligation to return here to us in Lios Mï¿½r.'The abbot gazed at his steward thoughtfully and then asked softly, 'Do you imply censure of Brother Cathal?'Brother Lugna regarded the abbot coldly. 'I did not mean to imply anything of the sort. Cathal remained in Tarentum because he felt that he had been called by the Christ to serve there. However, the point is that he remained there. The Lady Eithne feels a betrayal that he has not returned. She told me so. And his brother, Donnchad, has not been himself since his journey back to us. And it was an amazing journey. North to Rome, where I have studied; from there to our brethren in Lucca and then on to the famous Bobbio, until finally he returned to us here, bathed in glory.' The steward's voice rose with pride. 'How many of our brethren have been on such a glorious pilgrimage? Just to touch the soles of his sandals which have trodden the same earth and stone that was walked upon by ou...</p><h2>Rack, Ruin and Murder (Campbell Carter Mystery 2)</h2><p>The discovery of a dead body shatters the tranquillity of a Cotswold village in Ann Granger&#39;s second Campbell and Carter mystery.

Are they equipping the church in biblical principles of government and public affairs so as to act and think in a manner that produces liberty? Rev.

This book is written to help correct this neglect. The responsibilities of pastors include equipping Christians to fulfill their Godly civil duties. This book examines what those duties are and how the church can effectively prepare its members to be salt in the public arena in a manner that transcends parties and personalities.</p><p>Stephen McDowell is the President of the Providence Foundation.

For this archipelago was itself a supreme sea power, if non-expansionist.

Kadushin ably succeeds at creating an addictive listen from Meyer's tumultuous story of star-crossed lovers. The combination will not disappoint.

While English commerce with the Mediterranean world expanded, Ottoman forces invaded Greece, Hungary, and Austria. At the same time, "Turkish" pirates and renegades from North Africa roamed the Atlantic and raided the coast of England. The threat was ideological as well: English sailors captured by Barbary pirates sometimes renounced their faith and converted to Islam. <br><br>Here, three important early modern "Turk" plays&#x2015;Robert Greene's <i>Selimus, Emperor of the Turks</i> (1594); Robert Daborne's <i>A Christian Turned Turk</i> (1612); and Philip Massinger's <i>The Renegado</i> (1623)&#x2015;are available for the first time. These texts represent Islamic power and wealth in scenes of piracy on the high seas, on-stage execution by strangulation, and rites of religious conversion. The plays are set in historical and cultural context by Daniel J. Vitkus's clear and thoughtful introduction. These carefully edited, annotated, modern-spelling editions are particularly valuable for understanding the cultural production of English identity in relation to the Islamic Other.</p><p>These texts represent Islamic power and wealth in scenes of piracy on the high seas, on-stage execution by strangulation, and rites of religious conversion.

This time Bryant and May are up against a series of bizarre murders that defy human understanding&#x2014;and a killer no human hand may be able to stop.<br><br>A mysterious stranger in outlandish Edwardian garb defaces a painting in the National Gallery. Then a guest at the exclusive Savoy Hotel is fatally bitten by what appears to be a marshland snake. An outbreak of increasingly bizarre crimes has hit London&#x2014;and, fittingly, come to the attention of the Peculiar Crimes Unit. <br><br>Art vandalism, an exploding suspect, pornography, rat poison, Gilbert and Sullivan musicals, secret societies...and not a single suspect in sight. The killer they&#x2019;re chasing has a dark history, a habit of staying hidden, and time itself on his side. Detectives John May and Arthur Bryant may have finally met their match, and this time they&#x2019;re really working against the clock....</p><p>Christopher Fowler is the acclaimed author of fourteen previous novels, including the first four Bryant &amp; May novels,<b> Full Dark House</b>, which won the BFS August Derleth Novel of the Year Award and was nominated for a Barry Award, <b>The Water Room</b>, <b>Seventy-Seven Clocks</b>, and <b>Ten Second Staircase</b>. He lives in London, where he is at work on his sixth novel featuring Arthur Bryant and John May.<i>Chapter One<br>Lights Out</i><br><br>She recognized the symptoms immediately.<br><br>The stipple of sweat in the small of her back. Ice-heat prickling her forehead. A sense of skittering panic in the pit of her stomach. As she walked faster, she thought: <i>This is absurd, it can't harm me</i>. But beneath her mind's voice ran another, dark and urgent. <i>It's not the night, but what waits in it</i>.<br><br>The sun had barely set, but the road ahead was indistinct in the fading light. She refused to consider what might be out there. <i>The Prince of Darkness is a gentleman</i>, hissed the voice, a phrase recalled from her schooldays. She had no intention of meeting the prince this evening, and quickened her pace, not daring to look back. The clouds of night opened like ink blossoming in water, threatening to overtake her. Blackbirds skirted the trees, taking measure of the rising wind.<br><br>For as long as she could remember, Jerry Gates had been terrified of the dark. The cause of this nyctophobia was beyond the reach of recollection: some early trauma at the top of the stairs, perhaps. Her mother accused her of having an overactive imagination; she made it sound like a harmful thing. Others would have seen misted fields on either side of the road, bare elm trees blurring in the dusk. Jerry could see demons swarming.<br><br>She tried to read her watch, but it was too dark. <i>Screw Nicholas and his country weekend</i>, she thought. If he'd shown some warning sign of his intentions, she would never have come in the first place. The man should have been wearing a red toggle, <i>Pull To Inflate Ego</i>, like a life jacket. His personality had changed the moment he'd realized that she wasn't going to bed with him.<br><br>Now it was almost dark, and she was stuck in the deserted Kent countryside on a Sunday night, without a car, in the freezing cold, with an irrational dread nipping at her, goading her into a trot. She was a town girl, used to city lights and cars and sirens and people. <i>It's so quiet around here you could hear a cow break wind five miles away. Where the hell is everybody?<br><br></i>She thought back over the weekend, and the mistake she had made in accepting his invitation. On Saturday morning they had 'motored down to the lodge'--Nicholas's words, as if they were living in the roaring twenties--in the red MG that kept stalling, its roof folded back to admit the freezing country air.<br><br>The 'lodge,' a damp Victorian monstrosity situated on the far side of Dettling, had been designed in such a way that the watery warmth of the winter sun was excluded from it through every phase of the earth's rotation. The ground floor was surrounded by tall wet nettles, the brickwork obscured by reeking fungus. The rooms were virtually devoid of furniture. There was no central heating. Nicholas's family might have breeding, but they obviously had no money. The upkeep of such property, he'd explained, was staggering, and his parents preferred to stay in their Knightsbridge flat.<br><br>It didn't take her long to realize that Nicholas used the empty house for sex. One look at the bedrooms was all she needed to know. Adult magazines, wine bottles, mirrors, and candles, a lad's pathetic idea of what would please women. The blinds were drawn tight in all the upper rooms, and probably remained so throughout the year.<br><br>Her partner's dinner conversation had consisted of college tales laden with sexual innuendo. Nicholas was a different person on his home ground, all smirk and swagger, and she hated it. It was as if she had ceased to be his friend, and had become his quarry. The second time he brushed her breast while reaching for the wine, Jerry had announced that she was going to bed. No amount of persuasion could keep her downstairs.<br><br>She'd spent a sleepless night barricaded into her room, wearily listening to his pleas and insults through the door.<br><br>She had never looked forward to dawn so much in her life. Rising at the earliest opportunity, she had listened to the farming forecasts of incoming rain while frying herself bacon. Shortly after ten Nicholas had appeared in his dressing gown. The blackness of his mood barely allowed him to acknowledge her presence. The rest of the morning passed in gelid silence. Denied his conquest, Nicholas had regressed to a sullen schoolboy.<br><br>Her uppermost concern had been the problem of getting home. Trouble with the car&#x2013;beneath which he passed most of the afternoon--prevented Nicholas from driving her to the station. Typically, there was no cab service operating in the area. Jerry found herself left alone to wander the rooms of the old farmhouse. As she examined the shelves of discoloured paperbacks, she grew more bored and upset. Finally she had collected her overnight bag and struck out across the field in the direction of the main road.<br><br>She would have been happy never to see him again, but he would be there the next morning, at work. They even shared the same damned counter. <i>Good judgement call, Jerry</i>, she thought. <i>You really know how to pick them.<br></i>She studied the dim road, hoping to see a light, but there was nothing. There was no rising moon. The darkness was nearly complete. The thought punched the air from her chest.<br><br>She began to run along the narrow lane as a downpour started. The rain added to her deepening panic. Bare branches entwined overhead like the spiny legs of insects. The trees and hedgerows were filled with scampering black imps that dropped with the rain and tried to catch her, but she ran on, hugging the curve in the road.<br><br>The dark drew forth stalking men. They lay in wait for her, appearing in clumps of wet leaves, unfolding their fingers like scythes. They could not survive in London, where there was always light even in the darkest hour, but here in the black woods and meadows they could pursue their pleasures without restraint . . . <br><br>Then she saw the light of the telephone box.<br><br>A red one, familiar as an old friend, with rectangular windows and directories and a buttery lightbulb that glowed through the torrent. She smothered her crawling fears and concentrated on the sanctuary ahead. Wrenching back the door on its leather straps, she threw herself inside.<br><br>Relief, afforded by the single bare lightbulb, washed over her, and she sank to her knees, filling the booth with angry sobs, furious at her own weakness. Everything had gone wrong. She had intended to use the weekend as a protest. Instead of attending some horrible charity dinner at Claridges with her parents, instead of keeping an appointment with her therapist, she had taken off for a weekend with a man she barely knew. She might even have had sex with Nicholas if he'd proved to be a halfway decent human being. She'd only wanted to show everyone that she had a mind of her own, but even carrying out this simple task had been beyond her.<br><br>As the rain pounded the roof, she drew the knees of her fringed jeans up beneath her chin and wept, crouching low in the fetid booth, protected from surrounding blackness as hostile as the surface of an alien planet.<br><br>She remained trapped in the haven of light, not daring to move, until a passing motorist found her over two hours later.<br>2/Seizure<br><br><i>Daily Telegraph, Monday 6 December 1973<br></i><br><b>MONDAY'S OUTLOOK<br></b>The fine sunny spells of the last few days are set to end as we bid farewell to the capital's unseasonably clear skies.

No one in London should ever be surprised by the weather, but this year we can expect winter to arrive with a vengeance.<br>The elderly lawyer dropped his newspaper on to the marble surface of the washroom counter. <i>Nothing in the business section about the Japanese bid</i>, he thought. <i>At least that's something to be thankful for</i>. Besides, he had something else on his mind. He was still annoyed about his hotel room. But there was no way he could pursue the matter further. He had complained as much as he dared; to say any more would risk drawing attention to himself.<br><br>He filled the sink with fiercely heated water and splashed some on his face. What a business; never in all his years of dealing with the family had he heard of such a thing. He stared back at himself from red-rimmed eyes. He needed a good night's sleep. He could do with being ten years younger, too. He was tired of doing the dirty work for others. His profession had once been a noble one.<br><br>He dried his hands on a thick cotton towel. A reflected movement in one of the stalls turned him from the basins. One of the cubicles was occupied. As he watched, the toilet door swung half open. The figure behind it remained in shadow, silently watching.<br><br>The lawyer stepped to one side, trying to see the face. The door swung slowly wide until it banged against the tiled wall.<br><br>He tried to raise the alarm, but the wretched cloth-wrapped creature ran forward and raised his hands, pressing them over the lawyer's face.<br><br>After that there was nothing.<br><br>Nothing at all.<br>Then it was a second, a minute, an hour later.<br><br>He had no idea how much time had passed, but he was still in the washroom, lying by the basins, feeling dizzy. He checked his ornate gold wristwatch, but had trouble focusing. He had a terrible headache. His neck hurt. The washroom was empty. The cubicles stood with their doors wide, the silence broken only by a dripping tap. He needed to take a short nap. Unable to comprehend what had happened, Maximillian Jacob pulled himself up, picked up his newspaper and weaved his way back to the lobby of the Savoy Hotel. He located a deep armchair in a quiet corner, where he could rest without being disturbed.<br>Jerry Gates checked her watch again and frowned. Five to six. Another five minutes until the evening receptionist was due to take over. Through the foyer doors she watched the turning taxis' beams fragmenting through needles of rain...</p><h2>National Audubon Society First Field Guide: Fishes</h2><p>Explores the world of fishes, discussing their classification, anatomy, behavior, and habitat, and providing photographs and detailed descriptions of individual taxonomic families.</p><p></p><h2>SHATTERED</h2><p>Eight months after being horribly disfigured in a car accident, Dan Marriott has his face rebuilt by plastic surgery, but he must still struggle with an amnesia that could mean his death as he is stalked by an unknown killer</p><p></p><h2>Payment in Full</h2><p>A young Jewish couple vows to raise an eight-year-old black girl true to her own culture and heritage, in a novel about racial prejudice and intolerance</p><p>As a scenario for the triumph of racial justice, this gently sentimental story by the author of The Choice accomplishes its mission, albeit in platitudinous style. Among the immigrant population of New York City's Lower East Side during the 1930s, David and Rebecca Rosen, deeply religious Jews, grieve over Rebecca's inability to have a child. When Rebecca encounters an eight-year-old black girl who has been temporarily placed in the care of a Jewish orphanage while her mother is dying, she takes the audacious step of bringing Elvira into her home. Surmounting the shock of their families and the anxiety of her husband concerning threats to his prospering business, and ignoring the well-intentioned advice of professionals, Rebecca guarantees that Elvira's heritage is not lost while the child also absorbs the Rosens' religious rituals; among the amusing ethnic bridge-building is the intermingling of black and Jewish cuisines. We follow bright, inquiring Elvira through a childhood and adolescence spent in all-white settings--the Rosens move to Central Park West, vacation in the Catskills. Eventually, she becomes a professor at Hunter College and the mother of New York's first black police commissioner. Denker's warm picture of ideal racial relationships is marred by persistently stiff dialogue and soap opera situations. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Dandy Gilver and a Most Misleading Habit</h2><p>Dandy Gilver and a Most Misleading Habit</p><p>Catriona McPherson was born in the village of Queensferry in south-east Scotland in 1965 and educated at Edinburgh University.

By the end of 1945, the SS concentration camp system had become an overwhelming landscape of terror. Twenty-two large camps and over one thousand satellite camps throughout Germany and Europe were at the heart of the Nazi campaign of repression and intimidation. The importance of the camps in terms of Nazi history and our modern world cannot be questioned. Dr Nikolaus Wachsmann is the first historian to write a complete history of the camps. Combining the political and the personal, Wachsmann will examine the organisation of such an immense genocidal machine, whilst drawing a vivid picture of life inside the camps for the individual prisoner. The book will give a voice to those typically forgotten in Nazi history: the &#39;social deviants&#39;, criminals and unwanted ethnicities that all faced the terror of the camps. Wachsmann will explore the practise of institutionalised murder and inmate collaboration with the SS selectively ignored by many historians. Pulling together a wealth of in-depth research, official documents, contemporary studies and the evidence of survivors themselves, The Camps will be a complete but accessible narrative.</p><p><b>Nikolaus Wachsmann</b> is a professor of modern European history at Birkbeck College, University of London.

Mr. Wachsmann's most impressive achievement in this synthetic work is his portraits of individual human beings. It takes hard effort to assemble enough sources on inmates or SS men to sustain them as characters in a book of this length. The prisoners had a range of references to describe their ordeals, from the Book of Exodus through Dante's <i>Inferno</i>. In the generations since, their experience has become one of our points of reference in moral discussions, and it is all the more gratifying to see the camp inmates portrayed here with unvarnished humanity. Mr. Wachsmann has in effect united the best of the German and the British schools of grand World War II history: hugely but humbly exhaustive research with attention to character and to detailed narrative.&#x201d; &#x2015;Timothy Snyder, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;This is history writing of the highest order, and <i>KL</i> is surely one of the outstanding books written on the Third Reich in the past decade.

What we have lacked all this time is a synoptic analysis of the development and character of the entire Nazi camp system. Now we have it and it will not need to be done again.

Its value lies in no small measure in the way it weaves together the history both of the perpetrators and of the victims . . .

Nikolaus Wachsmann has written the first integrated history of Nazi concentration camps, unifying in a single narrative the policies and measures governing the inception and growth of the system, the context in which the monstrous <i>KL</i> developed and how each of its stages and facets was recorded and remembered by its victims. The study is essential for a further understanding of the Third Reich.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Saul Friedlander, author of The Years of Extermination: Nazi Germany and the Jews, 1939-1945 (winner of the Pulitzer Prize)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Nikolaus Wachsmann has written an admirable historical overview of the Nazi concentration camps, effectively combining decades of recent scholarship with his own original research.

Yet the night was still, soundless-so quiet she could hear her father's snoring at the other end of the house. She attempted to go back to sleep. She turned on her left side, but it wasn't long before she shifted to her right. Instead of feeling sleepy, it made her more awake. She couldn't shake the nagging feeling something was wrong.</p> <p>In frustration, she got out of bed and looked out the window. The night was overcast with clouds hiding the crescent moon. She could barely make out the silhouette of the trees that grew alongside the creek that flowed through their farm, the creek that carried water the ranchers depended on. Some distance away-too far for the sound to carry-water tumbled over the dam her father had built. After the ranchers blew up the first one, her father retaliated by building an even bigger one.</p> <p>She hated the strain between ranchers and anyone who attempted to farm more than an acre of ground. The ranchers admired someone like Nate Dolan, a handsome young man rich enough to buy the largest ranch in the county, yet filled with such hatred he spent most of his time searching for the man he said was responsible for his brother's death. It was no secret that Nate intended to kill Laveau diViere if he could. Apparently he didn't care that meant he'd hang. Stupid. Idiotic. Typically Texan.</p> <p>But she didn't want to think about Nate Dolan, the dam, the farm, or the ranchers. She was tired and needed to sleep. She turned back and crawled into bed. She'd hardly adjusted the blankets when her father stuck his head through the doorway.</p> <p>"There's somebody outside," he whispered.</p> <p>She threw back the covers and slid her feet into her slippers. "What are they doing?"</p> <p>"I don't know, but I expect it's one of those fool ranchers nosing around to see what damage he can do. I'm going to put a stop to it. Stay here."</p> <p>She wanted to go with him, but she'd never used a rifle, shotgun, or pistol. And no Texan who called himself a man paid any attention to a woman.</p> <p>"Don't light the lamp," her father warned when she followed him to the kitchen. "I don't want them to know I'm on to 'em."</p> <p>A premonition of danger gripped Roberta. "Don't go." A light flickering through the window warned of something else. "I think they've set fire to the barn."</p> <p>Muttering a string of curses, her father strapped on a holster carrying a single pistol. Then he grabbed his shotgun from the shelf and stuffed the pockets of his robe with shells. "I'll teach the sons of bitches to try to burn my barn," he swore.</p> <p>Deaf to all her pleas that he stay in the house, he disappeared through the doorway.</p> <p>She had never felt so helpless in her life. She had spent her first fourteen years in Virginia, where people didn't blow up dams or consider slinging on a gun an essential part of getting dressed. Shotguns in Virginia were used for birds and squirrels, rifles for deer and wild hogs. Horses pulled wagons. Cows were docile and milked twice a day. Men came home for supper rather than spend their evenings drinking and gambling. Women cooked and cared for their families. They didn't ride horses or use firearms. Even after five years in her new home, Texas was an alien universe.</p> <p>Two shots in quick succession changed the direction of her thoughts. She rushed to the window, but the cloud cover was so heavy she couldn't see her father or anyone else. After trying a second window without success, she ran to the door and wrenched it open.</p> <p>The blackness of night closed around her like a blanket thrown over her head. Shouts, occasional gunfire, and the grunts of horses came at her out of the murky shadows. Fear followed quickly on their heels. She heard her father calling the invaders cowards, bastards, scum of the earth. Blasts from his shotgun accompanied his insults. The bark of answering rifles was accompanied by curses that amazed Roberta by their variety and inventiveness.</p> <p>The fire blazed higher. She could see silhouettes of several hooded figures stoking the flames until they engulfed the whole side of the barn. Others rode their horses through her father's fields, destroying the crops. Her father barreled forward into this melee, a feeble force against so many. She called him to come back but had no expectation he could hear her, or that he would heed her if he did. He thrived on opposition. It didn't matter that he was badly outnumbered. That only made him more determined.</p> <p>Unable to stand around doing nothing, Roberta went inside and straight for the rifle her father had hung on pegs in the wall. She'd never handled a rifle before, but all she had to do was pull the trigger. Even a useless female could manage that.</p> <p>Yet after she'd returned to the doorway, she couldn't decide what to do. Even if she could overcome her natural repugnance at the thought of killing anyone, the men at the barn and in the fields were too far away. Shooting at them would mostly likely draw fire in her direction. Still, she couldn't go back in the house. She couldn't just watch, while everything her father had built during the last five years was destroyed.</p> <p>Deciding to stand alongside him, she headed toward the spot where he'd plunged into a potato field. She was only halfway there when she heard a howl of pain.</p> <p>"You damned son of a bitch!" someone shouted. "You shot me."</p> <p>He sounded surprised. Surely he couldn't have thought her father would fire into the air in a futile attempt to scare him off. Not even a Texas cowboy could be that dumb!</p> <p>There was just enough light for her to see the man take a shot at her father. It missed. The rider cursed and fired another shot that missed.</p> <p>"Get back doing what you're supposed to do."</p> <p>The raspy voice-clearly in the habit of giving commands-sounded vaguely familiar. Roberta looked around to see where it had come from, but it was too dark, there were too many people, and everyone was in constant motion. She turned back to find her father running toward the barn. A break in clouds allowed enough light for her to see that several hooded riders had trampled much of the field. She was tempted to shoot the first person she got close to.</p> <p>A lasso spun out of the darkness and settled over her father. A second lasso pinned his arms to his sides. Keeping her father immobile between them, the riders forced him to watch as they drove his livestock from the barn. Driven by their inherent fear of fire, the mules quickly disappeared into the night, but the pigs milled around senselessly, allowing the hooded figures to make a game of shooting at them. Fortunately, someone opened the gate to their pen, and the survivors of the massacre fled into the night. The squeals of the wounded animals formed a piteous backdrop to the attack. Despite her rage at the brutal shooting of helpless animals, Roberta was relieved when the last wounded pig was put out of its misery. Intent on further destruction, a rider pulled down the chicken coop, sending the squawking hens flapping into the darkness. Her father could do nothing but watch helplessly as five years of work was systematically devastated.</p> <p>A hooded rider who had watched until now rode up to one of the men holding a lasso. At a signal, both riders let their ropes go slack. At that moment, the late arrival drew his gun and shot her father in the chest. Then he calmly turned and rode away as her father staggered a few steps before slumping to the ground.</p> <p>For a moment, Roberta's mind went blank. When she next became aware of her surroundings, she was bending over her father, calling his name, begging someone to help get him to a doctor. But there was no one left to hear her.</p> <p>Ripping a strip from her nightgown, Roberta struggled to stanch the flow of blood, but the bullet had pierced her father's lung. When he tried to speak, he choked on his own blood. She could do nothing but cradle him while, bathed by her tears, he died in her arms.</p> <p>Driven beyond reason by the horrific events, she reached for the gun in her father's holster. Whirling around at the sound of an approaching horse, she didn't care that the man wasn't wearing a mask, or that he was coming from the direction of town. Blinded by tears and in the grip of helpless rage, she fired in his direction. Certain she had missed, and beyond caring if she had, she flung the gun aside, and covered her father's body with her own.</p> <p>Roberta didn't know how long she lay there before the shock began to wear off. At first she was aware only of the silence. After the horror of the last minutes, it seemed enormous, unending, as though she was the only person left on earth. Gradually a mixture of sounds penetrated her consciousness. Voices. Hooves. Wagons. Running footsteps. They must have seen the fire from town.</p> <p>"Grab a bucket," someone shouted. "There's a water tank behind the barn."</p> <p>Roberta knew there weren't enough buckets and not enough water to put out the fire.</p> <p>More and more people arrived, all moving around her, shouting instructions, asking questions, wondering who had led the attack and why. The thunder of an explosion in the distance brought the activity to a halt.</p> <p>"Clear out!" a man shouted. "They just blew up the dam."</p> <p>Someone took hold of Roberta's shoulder and tried to lift her to her feet, but she clung to her father's body.</p> <p>"You've got to move," a gentle female voice urged. "People say there's a lot of water behind that dam."</p> <p>Roberta knew there was no need to panic. A relatively small hole in the middle would achieve the same effect as blowing up the whole dam, and it wouldn't endanger anyone. Still, she allowed herself to be brought to her feet. She was too grief-stricken to pay attention to the arms that enveloped her or to attempt to identify the men who carried her father's body toward the house.</p> <p>"Lay him in his bed."</p> <p>Roberta recognized the voice of Boone Riggins, a man who asked her to marry him at least once a month. She had refused his offers, but now his was a friendly face in this night of unbelievable horror. With an anguished cry, she flung herself at him and burst into tears. Even though she couldn't stop crying long enough to put together a coherent sentence, she poured out everything that had happened. When she finally stopped, her body was racked by painful hiccups.</p> <p>"Here, drink this." The gentle female voice.</p> <p>Roberta grasped a dipper in two hands, brought it to her mouth, and drank. After she'd drained the dipper, she took a deep, steadying breath. Then, for the first time since she had seen her father fall, she was able to take note of her surroundings. The room was full of people, half of whom she didn't recognize, all facing her, waiting for her response.</p> <p>"Thank you for taking care of my father. I would never have been able to move him by myself."</p> <p>"What happened?"</p> <p>"Who did this?"</p> <p>"Did you recognize anybody?"</p> <p>Questions were thrown at her from every corner of the room until they sank of their own weight.</p> <p>"I don't know who did this," she managed to say. "They all wore hoods, but the killing of my father was deliberate. They held him between two ropes and forced him to watch while they tried to destroy everything he'd built. Then a man who seemed to be the leader shot him."</p> <p>"Who blew a hole in the dam?"</p> <p>She whipped around to face a middle-aged man standing in the doorway. "Where have you been the last four years?" Roberta cried. "The ranchers have done everything they could to run us out ever since my father built that second dam."</p> <p>"Threats are one thing, but killing a man..." Sheriff Bryce Kelly entered the house. "I don't know a single rancher in the county who'd do such a thing."</p> <p>"Well, somebody did it," Roberta said. "Who else would have a reason?"</p> <p>"It could have been strangers," someone suggested.</p> <p>"Strangers would have looted the place. Those men didn't take anything."</p> <p>"What are you going to do now?" the sheriff asked.</p> <p>Roberta hadn't had time to think about that, but once the question had been asked, she knew the answer. "I'm going to put this farm back together. I'm going to see that the man who killed my father hangs. Then I'm moving back to Virginia."</p> <p>"You can't run this farm by yourself," the sheriff said.</p> <p>"Why not?"</p> <p>"You're a woman."</p> <p>Roberta didn't have the energy to say half the things that sprang to mind. "I'll worry about that after I bury my father."</p> <p>An awkward silence followed. Roberta was thankful for the concern of the people gathered in the room, but she needed to be alone.</p> <p>A soot-streaked man came to the door. "The fire's out, but there's not much of the barn left. When we ran out of water, we just threw dirt on it. Worked better than we expected." He moved aside to let the town doctor come in.</p> <p>"I need a bed," the doctor said to Roberta. "I've got a man out here who's badly wounded."</p> <p>"Who?" Bryce asked.</p> <p>"Nate Dolan."</p></p><h2>E M Bounds: The Classic Collection On Prayer (Pure Gold Classic)</h2><p>Based on the firm foundation of scripture, the author shares in a simple, yet profound way, the methods, the necessity, and the possibilities of prayer. He pulls examples and anecdotes from across the centuries using saints from scripture, the early church, and his contemporaries, to clarify each principle he presents. Reach the heart of God, fall in line with His will, and experience His power and closeness through prayer.<br></p><p>Edward McKendree Bounds (1835&#x2013;1913) was born on August 15, 1835, in a small northeastern Missouri town. He attended a one&#x2013;room school in Shelbyville, where his father served as a county clerk, and he was admitted to the bar shortly before he reached the age of nineteen. An avid reader of the Scriptures and an ardent admirer of John Wesley's sermons, Bounds practiced law until the age of twenty&#x2013;four, when he suddenly felt called to preach the Gospel. <br><br>His first pastorate was in the nearby town of Monticello, Missouri. Yet, in 1861, while he was pastor of a Methodist Episcopal church in Brunswick, the Civil War began, and Bounds was arrested by Union troops and charged for sympathizing with the Confederacy. He was made a prisoner of war and was held for a year and a half before being transferred to Memphis, Tennessee, and finally securing his release.<br><br>Armed only with an unquenchable desire to serve God, Bounds traveled nearly one hundred miles on foot to join General Pierce's command in Mississippi. Soon afterward he was made chaplain to the Confederate troops in Missouri. After the defeat of General John Hood's troops at Nashville, Tennessee, Bounds was again among those who were captured and held until swearing loyalty to the United States.<br><br>After the war, Bounds pastored churches in Nashville, Tennessee; Selma, Alabama; and St. Louis, Missouri. It was in Selma that he met Emma Barnett, whom he later married in 1876, and with whom he had three children, one of whom died at the age of six. After Emma's death, in 1887, bounds married Emma's cousin, Harriet Barnett, who survived him. The family included their five children, as well as two daughters from his first marriage.<br><br>While he was in St. Louis, Bounds accepted a position as associate editor for the regional Methodist journal, the . Then, after only nineteen months, he moved to Nashville to become the editor of the Christian Advocate, the weekly paper for the entire Methodist Episcopal denomination in the South. <br><br>The final seventeen years of his life were spent with his family in Washington, Georgia, where both Emma and Harriet had grown up. Most of the time he spent reading, writing, and praying, but he often took an active part in revival ministry. Bounds was also in the habit of rising at four o'clock each morning in order to pray to God, for the great cares of the world were always upon his heart. He died on August 24, 1913, still relatively unknown to most of the Christian sphere.<br><br>Since the time of the apostles, no man besides Edward McKendree Bounds has left such a rich inheritance of research into the life of prayer. Prayer was as natural to him as breathing the air. He made prayer first and foremost in his life because he knew it as the strongest link between man and God. In the time of E.M. Bounds, human weakness, through prayer, could access the power of the overcoming Son of God, Jesus Christ. The same is true to this day.<br></p><h2>Behind the Forbidden Door: Travels in Unknown China</h2><p>Among the first Western journalists accredited in the People&#39;s Republic of China, the author lived in China in the Chinese manner, taking a Chinese name and sending his children to Chinese schools, and here reports on his extensive travels across the country</p><p>While a student at Columbia University in the 1960s, Terzani, who was born and raised in Italy, came to believe so deeply in the Maoist goal of creating a socialist utopia that he became fluent in Chinese, adopted a Chinese name and applied to the Chinese government for permission to move to the People's Republic, which was granted in 1980. This volume chronicles his four years there and his disillusionment not only with Mao's regime, but with Deng Xiaoping's as well. He describes the destruction of much of China's cultural legacybuildings, shrines, artworkfrom Peking to the outermost provinces; the rampant pollution; discrimination against minorities, notably Tibetans; the loss to the people of many traditional amenities (Mao termed pets "bourgeois indulgences" and had the animals killed). Terzani argues that Western views of Deng as a liberal ruler guiding his nation along a capitalist road are naive; that Deng's overriding goal is the maintenance of party control; that his chief modernization has been the streamlining of the police apparatus along the lines of the KGB. As a result of the reports on China he published in European journals, Terzani was arrested and expelled from the country. He concludes, "The Chinese remain the greatest illusionists in the world. Only the illusion changes." Terzani is now der Spiegel's Far Eastern correspondent, based in Tokyo. (August 11)OOD MORNING, I'M JOAN<br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.Terzani lived in China for more than three years as a correspondent for Der Spiegel. He arrived with an attraction for China and a determination to assimilate: he spoke Chinese, read Chinese papers, and sent his children to Chinese schools. The experience turned him sour and left him feeling "if Mao's policies had brought China great misery, what Deng Xiaoping was doing in order to half-reverse those policies left me equally skeptical." The Chinese didn't like his articles or his attitude and expelled him in March 1984. His articles, collected here, make fascinating reading. The best are those that capture the real and often frightening contradictions in the 1980s reform policies for industry, agriculture, and family planning. Terzani's view is similar to that of Simon Leys, whose Chinese Shadows ( LJ 7/77) charged that Beijing had destroyed the traditional Chinese heritage and substituted narrow Leninist dogma to produce an impoverished culture.David D.

Peterson describes his remarkable life story beginning in Kearney, Nebraska as an eight-year-old manning the cash register at his father's Greek diner through his "Mad Men" advertising days, to Secretary of Commerce in Nixon's paranoid White House, to the tumultuous days of Lehman Brothers, and to the creation of The Blackstone Group, one of the great financial enterprises in recent times. <br><br>In THE EDUCATION OF AN AMERICAN DREAMER, Peterson chronicles the progress of this journey with irony, humor and, sometimes, painful honesty. Within these pages are stories of marriage and family hardship; lessons in political gamesmanship; thoughts on his obsessive desire to succeed; and, finally, learning the meaning of "enough." From his advertising days in Chicago in the 1950's to becoming the youngest CEO of a Fortune 300 Company, he shares with us his rise to the top and the price paid along the way. As the youngest Cabinet member in the Nixon administration, he describes his survival techniques in a hubris-driven and paranoid White House, including his turbulent turf wars with Treasury Secretary John Connally leading to Peterson's abrupt and highly publicized firing. His stewardship of Lehman Brothers is a Shakespearian tale of a CEO who struggled to deal with partners who were plotting his demise and, at the same time, turning an institution on the brink of bankruptcy to one with 5 straight years of record profits. <br><br>His life's story is about doing well by doing good. In the wake of Blackstone's highly successful public offering, Peterson found himself an 80-year old instant billionaire, on the verge of retirement. And like many lifetime workers and over-achievers, he suddenly confronts an unexpected, depressing identity crisis. His solution? Committing a great bulk of his net proceeds to establish the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, his philanthropic endeavor to do something about America's politically untouchable challenges that threaten America's future, among them massive entitlement obligations, ballooning health care costs, and our energy gluttony.<br><br>Ultimately, this is a man's account of his legendary successes, humiliating failures, and personal tragedies - a testament to a remarkable life and, indeed, to the American Dream itself.</p><p><strong>Peter G. Peterson </strong>lives in New York City with his wife Joan Ganz Cooney, a founder of the Sesame Workshop, and is the father of five children and grandfather of nine. His most recent book, <i>Running On Empty, </i>was a national bestseller. He is the Chairman Emeritus and co-founder of The Blackstone Group, Chairman Emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations and founding Chairman of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, founding President of The Concord Coalition, and retired Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. He is also founding Chairman of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation."For years, Pete Peterson has performed with distinction on the world's stage-both in finance and public policy. But he still remains the same Nebraska boy who counted change in his father's cafï¿½. His journey is a remarkable story and his book is an entertaining and refreshingly honest account of his education in business and life." (<b>Warren Buffett</b>)<br><br>The name Peter G. Peterson brings to one's mind the word success. From advertising to finance to politics, Peterson has proved to one and all that he has the ability and foresight to lead a generation of thinkers. His ability to say no to things that would tempt even the strongest of us, he has made choices in his life based on his own ideals and the ability to look forward.

This is a matter of concern, not only to the Church of God in general, but to each Christian in particular. To each believer comes the unmistakably clear command of his Lord and Master: Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature (Mark 16:15). With the object of aiding young Christians to fulfill this divinely given task, this book has been written. This books brings A. P. Gibb s encyclopedic knowledge of preaching within our reach. His seriousness, thoroughness, energy, and urgency are evident throughout this book. As is the case with all of Mr. Gibbs books, much material is packed into this book, and each chapter contains a wealth of helpful suggestions. The illustrations of the various types of sermons are especially helpful.</p><p>Alfred P. Gibbs (1890-1967) was a man born to preach. At an early age Gibbs came to know, love, and serve the Lord Jesus Christ. He studied at Moody Bible Institute in Chicago and thereafter carried on an itinerant Bible teaching and writing ministry, chiefly in the United States and Canada. Gibbs published his first book, The Marvelous City of Mansoul in 1926. In all he wrote fourteen books and booklets, including Christian Baptism, The Lord s Supper, Scriptural Principles of Gathering, and Worship, all published by ECS Ministries. All his books have intensity like the man who wrote them. He was full of his subject. He also composed poetry and wrote Christian hymns. Gibbs never married, considering himself a eunuch for the kingdom of God. He was a model of the advice he gave, a spiritual man, a practical man, and fun to be with besides. For Gibbs, to hold forth the Word of life was a lifetime passion.</p><h2>Practical Mysticism</h2><p>"God gives without stint all that the creature needs, but it must do its part. He gives the wheat: we must reap and grind and bake it." ï¿½ Evelyn Underhill<br><br>In these two classics, British poet and mystic Evelyn Underhill shows herself to be one of the most authoritative modern voices on mysticism. Written on the eve of World War I,<i> </i><b>Practical Mysticism</b> reviews the works of the greatest Western mystics, including Teresa of Avila, Julian of Norwich, and Thomas ï¿½&nbsp; Kempis. Underhillï¿½ s goal is to guide her readers on a journey toward mystical consciousness, to teach them to see the ï¿½ eternal beauty beyond and beneath apparent ruthlessness.ï¿½ <i> </i><b>Abba</b>, first published in 1940, takes as its starting point the seven phrases of the Lordï¿½ s Prayer, using them as a means to propel the self toward union with God. In these important works, Underhill brings an often esoteric subject onto a practical footing, showing that the profound gifts of mysticism are not only for the few but are within reach of us all.</p><p><b>Evelyn Underhill</b>&nbsp;(1875&#x2013;1941) was an English author and mystic. A popular spiritual adviser and retreat leader, she was an advocate for contemplatitve prayer and mysticism as an underlying foundation of any religious or spiritual practice. Her works include <i>Practical Mysticism, The Spiritual Life, </i>and<i> Worship</i>, as well as several books of fiction and poetry.</p><h2>A Hesychast from the Holy Mountain in the Heart of a City: Saint Porphyrios of Kavsokalyvia</h2><p>Elder Porphyrios of Kavsokalyvia (1906-1991), who was formally glorified as a saint by the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in November 2013, has long been acknowledged and recognized as a luminary and spiritual guide with the special grace of &#39;clear sight&#39;. His life was particularly remarkable in that he lived it in both ascetic fastnesses and urban contexts. He left the world for Mount Athos at a young age and joined the Skete of Kavsokalyvia where, and it was there he underwent his most powerful formative experiences and received his gift of grace, and he always considered it his spiritual home. Bad health, however, forced him to return to the world and at the beginning of the second World War in Greece he was appointed chaplain of the Polyclinic hospital next to Omonia Square in the heart of the city of Athens. After thirty-three years at the Polyclinic he went on to found the Holy Monastery of the Transfiguration at Milesi. in 1991, seeing his life was nearing its end, he returned to his hermitage on the Holy Mountain where he fell asleep in the Lord on 2 December. This short study of the life and teaching of Saint Porphyrios is, in the words of its author Athanasios Papathanasiou, &#39;an exercise in encounter with the present&#39;. He takes into consideration present realities and conditions, both in the Church and society, and in the light of theology understood as a living discipline endeavours to determine certain especial qualities of the saint, drawing particularly on the saint&#39;s own words as recorded in the book &#34;Wounded by Love: The Life and Wisdom of Elder Porphyrios&#34;. His insights and interpretations have an immediacy and freshness of singular relevance to our perception of what constitutes a holy personage in the modern world and point to how we can reorient our thinking accordingly. Athanasios Papathanasiou is a lecturer at the Hellenic Open University and the editor of the journal Synaxi.</p><p></p><h2>Fine Woodworking Design Book Seven: 360 Photographs of the Best Work in Wood</h2><p>Fine Woodworking Design Books provide the best work in wood from craftsmen around the world.

A young girl's visit to her grandfather's house and her inability to discern just exactly what seems odd sets the stage for showing ever more ridiculous images from the foyer to the garden. In the dining room, the man blowing bubbles in Chardin's Soup Bubbles leans out of the frame to sip lemonade through a long straw. The child plants light "bulbs" in the flower "bed" (complete with pillow and headboard). The chair feet in the living room have shoelaces, and a flower blooms from the lily-pad rug. Reflections, shadows, skewed balance, and impossible perspectives are all employed in Legge's otherwise realistic watercolors. An adult might pick up allusions to Escher and Magritte, but the presentation is highly original. In the end, the girl figures out what is different: Grandpa's socks don't match! A sentence or two accompany each double-page scene. While the story is definitely secondary to the illustrations, this unusual book won't sit on the shelf. Multiple readings yield new surprises.?Wendy Lukehart, Dauphin County Library, Harrisburg, PA<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Visual jokes and trompe l'oeil overflow from newcomer Legge's watercolors as a girl visits her grandfather and notices that "something seem[s] odd." There is no dearth of candidates, for in Grandpa's house nothing is ordinary. Grandpa pours his visitor tea from a watering can; a kangaroo washes dishes with water that streams from an elephant's trunk; the cat watches fish in what is either a TV show or an actual acquarium. Finally the girl puts her finger on the problem-furnishing perhaps the reader's greatest surprise, she points out merely that Grandpa's socks are mismatched. The laugh they share demonstrates that the girl is in fact well acquainted with the eccentricities of her grandfather's household (rather than being, as the reader has most likely been imagining, colossally unobservant). This clever turnaround gives dimension to an otherwise slim premise, providing a satisfying last laugh. Satisfying as well are the multiplicity of discoveries to be had in the illustrations, at once hyperrealistic in their style and surreal in their content. The visual possibilities can be plumbed for hours.

What they weren&#x2019;t expecting, though, was the story that emerged in the months that followed&#x2014;a story as beautiful as it was extraordinary, detailing their little boy&#x2019;s trip to heaven and back. Colton, not yet four years old, told his parents he left his body during the surgery&#x2013;and authenticated that claim by describing exactly what his parents were doing in another part of the hospital while he was being operated on. He talked of visiting heaven and relayed stories told to him by people he met there whom he had never met in life, sharing events that happened even before he was born. He also astonished his parents with descriptions and obscure details about heaven that matched the Bible exactly, though he had not yet learned to read. With disarming innocence and the plainspoken boldness of a child, Colton tells of meeting long-departed family members. He describes Jesus, the angels, how &#x201c;really, really big&#x201d; God is, and how much God loves us. Retold by his father, but using Colton&#x2019;s uniquely simple words, <i>Heaven is for Real</i> offers a glimpse of the world that awaits us, where as Colton says, &#x201c;Nobody is old and nobody wears glasses.&#x201d;</p><p>Todd Burpo is pastor of Crossroads Wesleyan, a wrestling coach, a volunteer fireman, and he operates a garage door company with his wife, Sonja, who is also a children&#x2019;s minister, busy pastor&#x2019;s wife, and mom.

Through the course of the work, Burpo recalls conversations he had with his son about what heaven was like. Christians will be encouraged, non-Christians not at all. This work is written in a plain, conversational style that Dean Gallagher narrates with great skill. Gallagher reads at a pace that is never hurried, even when recalling stressful incidents. He is expressive, but never melodramatic, throughout the production--especially when relating the anguish Burpo and his wife felt at nearly losing their child.

Founded by two Navy radiomen in 1919, luck and the infusion of capital from a wealthy adventurer and car salesman started the Zenith Radio Corporation on a journey that would propell it to the top of the United States electronics manufacturing industry. The rise was an interesting one, the cast of high profile. With access to the Zenith corporate archives and their discovery of the long sealed files of one of Zenith&#39;s founders, the authors present for the first time the documented story of Zenith radio and company from 1919 through 1935. Professors Cones and Bryant draw on their long experience as radio enthusiasts and writers for both the popular and scholarly press to tell the fascinating story of Zenith&#39;s impact on early radio history. They present a wealth of never before published photographs, documents, and information, as well as color portraits of many Zenith radios of the era.

Original.</p><p><p><b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> Something was almost ready to come out of warp. Something very big. </p><p> It was tripping all of Deep Space 9's proximity alarms, lighting up the sensor board in ways Ensign Thirishar ch'Thane had never seen before. If the readings were accurate -- and he was certain they were -- a subspace displacement of almost unheard-of proportions was heading directly for the station and playing havoc with the long-range sensor arrays. Shar found himself struggling with his console, fighting back his mounting frustration as each klaxon he muted was quickly replaced by another. </p><p> The sudden pins-and-needles sensation in his antennae alerted him to the fact that Commander Vaughn was standing just behind him. Shar tried not to look flustered; the commander had a casual manner about him much of the time, but Vaughn was always an intimidating presence. Most Andorians cultivated a polite, soft-spoken demeanor, even -- some might say <i>especially</i> -- when they were about to slip daggers between each other's ribs, but Shar was still adapting to Vaughn's habit of shifting back and forth between easygoing civility and Starfleet formality. </p><p> "Cardassian control interfaces take some getting used to, don't they?" he asked gently, sipping the noisome beverage Shar had learned was called "twig tea." </p><p> "Yes, sir," Shar admitted, thoroughly embarrassed. After six weeks as DS9's science officer, he thought he'd finally mastered the idiosyncrasies of his own console. To have the station's new first officer witness his sudden ineptitude was mortifying. </p><p> As if sensing his thoughts, Vaughn leaned over for a better view of the readings. "Relax, Ensign," he said. "Given the circumstances, it's no wonder the arrays are going haywire. Stay with it." </p><p> Shar let out a breath and concentrated. As he moved his long fingers over the board again, the klaxons finally began to diminish. When the last of them was silenced, Vaughn patted him on the shoulder. "Good. Whenever operating alien technology, I find it's usually helpful to keep in mind the psychology of the people who created it. In this case, extremely detail-oriented, meticulous, and thorough. Redundancies in the system are a given." </p><p> "I'll remember that, sir," Shar said. </p><p> "Something coming in?" Shar looked up to see Colonel Kira standing in the open doors of the station commander's office, her voice echoing loudly in the otherwise quiet operations center. </p><p> Returning to his position at the central ops table, Vaughn set up an interface with Shar's sensor board. "Certainly looks that way. Something quite large, coming in at low warp." </p><p> "Nog?" Kira asked, coming down the stairs to join Vaughn. </p><p> "It had better be," the commander said. "If it isn't, we're going to become a multi-gigaton smear of debris across the Denorios Belt." </p><p> Kira ignored Vaughn's commentary as she studied the tabletop display. "But no hail?" The question was directed at Shar. </p><p> "No, sir," Shar replied, "but we anticipated this. Something this big coming out of warp, when you consider the disruption to subspace, it's to be expected..." But Colonel Kira wasn't listening anymore. She was watching the track of blips on the table. </p><p> "Does it look to you like he's giving himself enough room to brake?" Kira asked Vaughn. </p><p> "It depends on how much momentum it had when Nog took it into warp," Vaughn said. "Let him do his job, Colonel. He seemed to know what he was doing. The kid is smart. And he has style to burn." </p><p> "Style," Kira repeated. "Nog?" She seemed to be having trouble forming an association between the two words. </p><p> "Sure," Vaughn said. "His little scheme. His solution for...all this." Vaughn waved his hand around the dimmer-than-usual operations center. Many of DS9's nonessential systems had been shut off during the ongoing state of emergency. Ever since the colonel had been forced to jettison the station's fusion core, DS9 had been running on a complex network of Starfleet emergency generators. The measure had bought them time, allowing the station to continue functioning, albeit at nearly a third of its normal power consumption. But after two weeks of running at full capacity, the system was showing the strain. In the last few days alone, entire sections of the station had been evacuated and powered down so as not to further overtax the generator network. In fact, with the exception of the scheduled aid convoys to Cardassia Prime and the three Allied ships patrolling space near the wormhole, DS9 was currently turning away all traffic. </p><p> The pulse of the station had slowed to a sluggish thud since Kira had ejected its great heart into space. The explosion, according to the Bajoran news feeds, had been visible across most of the planet's nightside, appearing like a new star just as the westernmost cities were slipping into evening and those easternmost were turning off their lights for the night. Young children had run outdoors thinking it was fireworks for a holiday while their grandparents, recalling the arrival of the Cardassian occupation fleet, had fought to keep them inside. </p><p> Shar was both intrigued and somewhat perplexed by the behavior of some of his crewmates as conditions aboard the station deteriorated. The more the place began to feel like a frontier outpost, the <i>happier</i> some of the old hands seemed to be. Dr. Bashir was practically giddy about it sometimes. Shar had begun to form the opinion that these people were in serious need of some leave time, a <i>lot</i> of leave time. <i>This is what happens,</i> he told himself, <i>when you associate with prophets, ghosts, and demons.</i> </p><p> Shar's attention swam back to the conversation between the commander and the colonel. "I admit I've been skeptical about this all along," Kira was saying. "But I hate to discourage Nog's initiative..." </p><p> "...and you didn't have any better ideas," Vaughn finished for her. </p><p> "Something like that," Kira said. Shar wondered if she minded that the commander finished sentences for her. Then again, he decided, the colonel seemed like the sort who would finish sentences for her commanding officer. He hadn't yet been asked to sit in on a briefing between Kira and her Bajoran superiors. <i>Now, that would be interesting,</i> he decided. </p><p> So far, there hadn't been any discussion about what would happen if Nog's plan didn't work, but Shar could not find it in himself to be too optimistic about DS9's future. The Cardassian station was thirty years old, and despite all the reengineering that Starfleet had put into it, it had taken quite a beating in recent years. Perhaps it would be a mercy to send the station spinning into Bajor's sun and start over fresh. In such a scenario, considering the strategic importance of the wormhole, it seemed likely that Starfleet would insist on constructing a new starbase, a project that would certainly cause controversy and discord among the Allies, unless Bajor's latest petition for Federation membership were put on a fast track. The Federation was war-weary and its resources were stretched thin. The Council would bend a polite ear to listen to all sides, but when it was done, they would send in the Starfleet Corps of Engineers no matter what anyone said. Shar knew how politics worked. Better, in fact, than he really wanted to know. </p><p> "Anything on the short-range sensors, Ensign?" Kira asked. </p><p> Shar blinked, then said, "I was told that the short-range array was to be taken offline until further notice. Sir." Shar attempted to project a mental image of Commander Vaughn issuing the order. He knew that Bajorans were no more psionic than most Andorians, but he thought it was worth the attempt. </p><p> Vaughn, apparently, had better than average psionic abilities for a human, because he picked up Shar's distress call. "I gave the order, Colonel," he said. "The patrol ships are more than capable of covering our front yard." </p><p> "I don't remember authorizing that," Kira said, and Shar felt himself singed by the heat of the glare she focused on Vaughn. He fought the urge to scratch his left antenna. </p><p> "You didn't," Vaughn said agreeably. "I decided to shut them down yesterday." He took a sip of tea. "You were busy dealing with the Cardassian liaison at the time. I didn't want to bother you with it. It was an easy choice: short-range sensors or lights." </p><p> Shar watched as the colonel held her first officer's gaze for a moment. He knew that Commander Vaughn's job had once been hers. Not long ago, it had been <i>her</i> responsibility to know <i>everything</i> that happened on the station. Shar had heard that she went through a similar period of adjustment with Vaughn's predecessor, Tiris Jast, and wondered how much Kira still blamed herself for Jast's tragic demise...and how much that misplaced guilt played on her natural impulse to micromanage the running of the station. Shar knew enough people with command responsibilities to know that one of the worst things about being promoted was coming to grips with the idea that you had to trust someone else to make some of the decisions. </p><p> Kira, it seemed, was still making that adjustment. Her apparent frustration didn't evaporate, but it did recede significantly. "Right," she said. "Lights. Good call, Commander." </p><p> Shar felt his own tension diminish just in time to hear Lieutenant Bowers report from tactical that he was receiving warning flashes from all three patrol ships, each going to heightened alert status as the monstrous subspace displacement closed on the Bajoran system. Shar shot a questioning glance toward Kira, and waited for her nod before bringing the short range sensors back online. </p><p> He found himself wishing he'd kept them off as he looked at the readings, cursing softly in his native tongue when he saw that the disruption to subspace had intensified markedly. The colonel didn't seem to notice his outburst, more concerned with instructing Bowers to activate the main viewscreen, but Commander Vaughn shot him a warning glance that indicated he might know some Andorii. </p><p> The viewscreen came online and Shar tried to divide his attention between the image on it and his console. Space split open with a rapidly dissolving warp field. Time seemed to slow down as the aperture continued to expand, stretching so wide that for a moment, in spite of everything he knew to the contrary about what was unfolding, Shar wondered if DS9 would be pulled inside. </p><p> Instead, something emerged. Led by a single runabout, nine assorted Federation starships moving in carefully calculated formation dropped out of warp as one, the bright blue cones of their tractor beams strategically distributed over the tremendous mass of their shared burden. How anyone had talked nine starship captains -- not to mention their chief engineers -- into even attempting such a thing, Shar couldn't guess. He didn't need to imagine the complex level of calibration and coordination that the operation required, or who was behind it; Nog had transmitted his revised plan before it had been implemented, and everyone but Commander Vaughn had pretty much decided that he was out of his mind. The computer models, not to mention Deep Space 9's increasing desperation, had finally convinced Kira that they had nothing to lose, and Shar privately began to suspect that the colonel shared Vaughn's apparent taste for audacity. </p><p> Shar saw the warning signs in the data stream flowing across the board, then looked back up at the viewscreen, expecting to see warp nacelles blowing out, warp cores ejecting, and clouds of white-hot plasma venting...but instead he saw something else: </p><p> Salvation. </p><p> He looked at the colonel. She was smiling -- no, grinning -- then whooping with triumph as she madly pounded the command station, unleashing the elation of a woman who, he knew, despite everything else she had experienced in her life, never took the miraculous for granted. </p><p> Shar looked up at the screen again. It was still there. </p><p> Empok Nor, Deep Space 9's long-abandoned twin. </p><p> "Colonel, we're receiving a hail from the <i>Rio Grande,"</i> Bowers announced. </p><p> "It's about time," Kira said, unable to get the smile off her face. "On screen, Lieutenant." </p><p> Bowers replaced the exterior scene with the image of Nog at the controls of the runabout. He looked, Shar thought, as though he hadn't slept in days. "Lieutenant Nog reporting in, Colonel." </p><p> "Nog, I -- " Kira started, then faltered and shook her head, words failing her. Finally she took a breath and tried again. "You realize this is going to ruin my view of the wormhole, don't you?" </p><p> Nog almost cracked a smile. "Not for long, Colonel," he assured her. "Once we transfer Empok Nor's lower core to Deep Space 9, we can tow what's left of the station someplace nearby and park it there for the next time we need spare parts." </p><p> "How did the station hold up?" Vaughn asked. </p><p> "Even better than the simulations projected, Commander," Nog said. "Some minor structural damage to two of the lower pylons, but for a ten-day low-warp journey across three light-years...not bad. It's like Chief O'Brien used to say about Deep Space 9: The Cardassians built this place to last." </p><p> "You look tired, Nog," Kira said. </p><p> Nog shrugged his shoulders, seeming to resist the urge to rub the large black circles under his eyes. "I'm fine, Colonel. Slept three hours last night. I'll be able to start work on the fusion-core transfer just as soon as we've stabilized our orbit." </p><p> "No, I don't think so," Vaughn said. "See that Empok Nor is stable, but I want you asleep in your quarters when you're finished." Nog began to protest, but stopped when he saw the tilt of Vaughn's head. "Don't force me to make it an order, Nog." </p><p> Nog sagged, then seemed to almost smile gratefully. "Yes, Commander. Thank you, sir. Colonel...I want you to know the SCE really came through. This wouldn't have happened without them, or the ships in the convoy." </p><p> Kira smiled. "I'll be sure to note that in my report, Nog." </p><p> "I also assured the convoy captains you'd be able to arrange shore leave for their crews on Bajor," Nog said, suddenly looking a little worried. "And any maintenance the ships might need..." </p><p> If Nog expected the colonel to be put out, he was disappointed. "Don't worry, Lieutenant," Kira said, still smiling. "I'll take care of it. And Nog?" </p><p> "Colonel?" </p><p> "Excellent work." </p><p> Nog's face split into a grin. "Thank you, Colonel," he said, and signed off. </p><p> Vaughn settled back into a chair and sipped his tea. He looked, Shar thought, as satisfied as he would be if he had just finished pulling the station all the way from the Trivas system himself. "I told you the kid had style." </p><p> </p><p> Copyright ï¿½ 2001 by Paramount Pictures</p></p><h2>The Autobiography of My Mother</h2><p>Narrated by an elderly West Indian woman looking back on her life, a story beginning at the height of imperialism and ending as colonialism fades deals with sex, human relations, and the interplay of power and powerlessness. By the author of Annie John. 75,000 first printing. Tour.</p><p>&#34;My mother died at the moment I was born, and so for my whole life there was nothing standing between myself and eternity,&#34; writes Jamaica Kincaid in this disturbing, compelling novel set on the island of Dominica. Born to a doomed Carib woman and a Scottish African policeman of increasing swagger and wealth, narrator Xuela spends a lifetime unanchored by family or love. She disdains the web of small and big lies that link others, allowing only pungent, earthy sensuality--a mix of blood and dirt and sex--to move her. Even answering its siren call, though, Xuela never loses sight of the sharp loss that launched her into the world and the doors through which she will take her leave.In a life not unlike those she writes about, Elaine Potter Richardson was born and raised on Antigua, a tiny island in the West Indies. Single-handedly raised by her struggling mother, she never knew her biological father. Brought up on a colonized island, Kincaid grew to harbor contempt toward the British regime, leery of the control they had. Having grown distant from her mother, she left home at 17 to become an au pair in New York, dyed her hair blonde, and changed her name to Jamaica Kincaid. She broke off all contact with her mother, took photography classes at the New School and made new friends. A few years later she entered the literary world with her first published article in <i>Ingenue</i>, an interview of Gloria Steinem. This led to her writing music critiques for the <i>Village Voice</i>. While accompanying a friend, George W.S. Trow, as he researched pieces for the <i>New Yorker </i>column "Talk of the Town," she started taking notes on events in the city. Trow passed her notes on to William Shawn, then the editor of the <i>New Yorker</i>, who spotted her talent and decided to print the notes as a piece. He went on to publish her first piece of fiction, an emotionally intense one-page monologue called "Girl," in 1978. A year later, Kincaid married his son Allen Shawn, a composer. She continued to write for the New Yorker until recently, when she left, unhappy with changes brought on by the new editor. Her first collection, <i>At the Bottom of the River</i>, was published in 1983, and soon after she began gaining a following as one of the decade's most notable new writers.<br><br>Often compared to other prominent authors such as Toni Morrison and V.S. Naipaul, Kincaid has continued to successfully produce acclaimed pieces of work, winning over critics and audiences alike. <i>At the Bottom of the River</i> received the Morton Dauwen Zabel Award of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, and was nominated for the PEN/Faulkner Award. In 1985 she published <i>Annie John, </i>introducing readers to her unique and luminous prose that has set her apart from other novelists. <i>A Small Place</i>(1988) and <i>Lucy</i> (1991) followed shortly after. <i>The Autobiography of My Mother</i>, which took Kincaid five years to write, has received wide recognition, shooting to bestseller lists across the country, and is regarded as her finest novel yet. When Kincaid is not busy raising her two children or obsessing in her garden, her favorite pastime, she is teaching both fiction writing and English at Harvard one semester a year.<br><br>Kincaid has risen from an economic and racially challenged childhood to one of the most revered writers of our time. Using her experience and passion, she writes moving and unsettling stories about human suffering, politics, power, and the relationships tying them together. She has said that she writes "to make sense of it all" to herself, not directing her work at anyone in particular. No matter, Kincaid's contribution to the literary world will no doubt have an everlasting effect on those who read her work.</p><h2>The Sermon on the Mount: The Message of the Kingdom (Preaching the Word)</h2><p><p>Within the three chapters of Matthew known as the Sermon on the Mount are truths so rich and deep that no matter how often or how closely we examine their words, they continually bring new relevance to our lives. Do you want to know what kind of character you should have as a Christian? What should define your outer way of life and your inner habit of mind? Then study the Sermon. Ponder each sentence and test yourself by it.</p><p>There is no other section of Scripture that brings you face to face with your own humanity and the grace of salvation as the Sermon does. As Christ masterfully expounds on the Kingdom of Heaven, He presents believers with the perfect standard of the Christian life. He challenges the genuineness of our words and actions, allowing us to know exactly where we stand in relation to the Kingdom. Both humbling and encouraging, it is the greatest message ever preached.</p><p>Kent Hughes faithfully explores the words that penetrate our hearts, and brings forth the lessons from this matchless model of the Christian life.&nbsp;Part of the&nbsp;Preaching the Word&nbsp;series.</p></p><p><p><strong>R.

The very name conjures up images of outrageous glamour and bold sexuality, opulence and daring. All of course true, but only half the story. Versace is also the legacy of a great creative genius from a poor, backward part of southern Italy who transformed the fashion world through his intuitive understanding of both women and how a changing culture influenced the way they wanted to dress. The first book in English about the legendary designer,&nbsp;<b>House of Versace</b> shows how Gianni Versace, with his flamboyant sister Donatella at his side, combined his virtuosic talent and extraordinary ambition to almost single-handedly create the celebrity culture we take for granted today.&nbsp;<br><br>Gianni Versace was at the height of his creative powers when he was murdered in Miami Beach. The story was front page news around the world and the manhunt for his killer a media obsession. His beloved sister Donatella demanded no less than a funeral befitting an assassinated head-of-state to be held in Milan&#x2019;s magnificent cathedral. In what was the ultimate fashion show, the world&#x2019;s rich and beautiful &#x2013; Princess Dianna, Elton John, Carla Bruni, Naomi Campbell, Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, Anna Wintour and others &#x2013; gathered to mourn a man already considered one of fashion&#x2019;s great pioneers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Deborah Ball, a long-time Milan correspondent for <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, conducted hundreds of interviews with Versace family members, Gianni Versace&#x2019;s lovers and business rivals, models such as Naomi Campbell whom he helped shoot to international stardom and fashion industry icons, including Anna Wintour, the legendary editor of <i>Vogue.</i>&nbsp;<br><br>Ball vividly recounts the behind-the scenes struggles &#x2013; both creative and business &#x2013; of Donatella as she stepped out of her brother&#x2019;s long shadow and took control of the House of Versace. The book offers the first inside look at the enormous challenges Donatella faced in living up to Gianni&#x2019;s genius, her struggle with a drug habit,&nbsp;her battles with her brother Santo and the mystery of why Gianni left control of his house to Donatella&#x2019;s young daughter, Allegra. <b>House of Versace</b> is a compelling, highly readable tale of rise from obscurity, a painful fall and ultimate redemption as the Versace empire returned to health &#x2013; for now.&nbsp;<br><br>Bringing together fashion, celebrity, business drama, jet-set lifestyles, and a notorious crime, <b>House of Versace</b> is an old-fashioned page-turner about a subject of enduring fascination.</p><p>A native of Boston, DEBORAH BALL has been a business journalist in Europe for more than 15 years. For 12 years, she has been a reporter for the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> in Milan, London and Zurich, covering a wide variety of business, finance and political topics. Between 1999 and 2002, she covered the European luxury goods sector for the Journal. Ms. Ball currently lives between Italy and Switzerland with her husband Fabrizio.One<br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ve Shot Gianni&#x201d;<br><br>It was midafternoon on July 15, 1997, and a breathless heat had settled on Rome, making the Eternal City so hot that stiletto heels sank slightly into the melting asphalt, leaving pockmarks on the sidewalk. Piazza di Spagna, with its undulating, double-helix staircase, was a hive of activity. Early that morning, police had cleared the cream-colored marble steps, shooing away the penny-ante artists and the slick Romeos who chatted up pretty tourists, so that television crews could mount bulky cameras and lights onto two makeshift towers.<br><br>The crews were setting up for the next evening&#x2019;s&nbsp;broadcast of Donna sotto le stelle, or Woman Under the Stars. Donna sotto le stelle was the sort of eye candy that had become a staple of Italian television in the 1980s. Eighteen<br>fashion houses, including Valentino and Fendi, would send their most fabulous evening gowns sashaying down the floodlit Spanish Steps, with the balmy backdrop of Rome adding to the festive air. To add a pinch of drama, the organizers of the show always chose one designer to honor. This year, they&#x2019;d picked Gianni Versace.<br><br>Gianni&#x2019;s sister, Donatella, had arrived the evening before at the Hotel De La Ville, a seventeenth-century palazzo turned hotel perched at the top of the steps. As usual, she stayed in the best room&#x2014;a deluxe eighth-floor penthouse with a wraparound terrace that offered postcard views stretching from the cupola of the Vatican to the Colosseum. The suite boasted a white baby grand piano, bequeathed to the hotel by composer Leonard Bernstein, who had once lived there for six months. Santo, the elder brother of Donatella and Gianni, hated fancy suites and had unpacked his bags in a more modest room at the same hotel.<br><br>That morning, each house had had an hour-long slot to rehearse its models on the Spanish Steps, the trickiest of catwalks, with 135 marble stairs, many worn slippery smooth from centuries of tourist traffic. Dozens of models gingerly tested their descents in the stilettos they would wear the next day. Donatella had the first slot for the rehearsal that morning. The producers knew the ratings dropped soon after the start of the show, as a marathon of pretty models in pretty clothes tired viewers quickly, so they had scheduled the most important designers first. This year, Versace was to open the show. Due to the unwieldy number of designers, the show&#x2019;s organizers had set a limit of no more than fifteen dresses each. Donatella had ignored the quota and brought thirty-five, confident that the house&#x2019;s signature glitz would be irresistible to the show&#x2019;s producers and that no one would complain.<br><br>Moreover, she was bringing Naomi Campbell, the star of supermodels, famous for her perfect body, her showmanship, and her ability to work a dress with grace and swagger. Naomi was too important to attend that morning&#x2019;s run-through, so another girl had stood in for her. Naomi had arrived in Italy a few days before to take in a quick holiday on the Amalfi coast, and a chauffeured car was ferrying her to Rome for the evening dress rehearsal. Even in a world crowded with million-dollar egos, Naomi was the ultimate diva, thanks as much to her personal antics as to her lithe body. The twenty-seven-year-old superstar&#x2019;s appetite for gorgeous men, fast cars, and copious amounts of cocaine provided endless fodder for gossip columns. Naomi&#x2019;s tantrums were legendary: She would throw such a violent fit over lost luggage in London that police officers had to drag her kicking and screaming from the plane. Another time, she threw a cell phone at her maid, leaving a gash that required stitches.<br><br>But with Gianni, Naomi was a different, more tractable creature. She had long been his favorite model&#x2014;the woman he often had in mind when he designed his gowns. She showed off his frocks in their full glamour, her feline grace a perfect foil for his lissome dresses. Versace had brought her fame as one of the original supermodels, the group of exquisite girls Gianni had launched. He also played the role of the protective big brother, a salve to her skittish, high-strung character. Cementing her bond with the clan, Naomi had become fast friends with Donatella, who often invited her for weekends at the Versace mansion on Lake Como.<br><br>As Naomi made her way to Rome, two conference rooms on the first floor of the Hotel De La Ville had been transformed into a makeshift backstage, overflowing with pre-fashion-show detritus, as makeup artists, hairdressers, and seamstresses wrangled the girls into the highly polished, ï¿½ber-sexy Versace look for the dress rehearsal. Dressed in skinny jeans and devoid of makeup, the girls sat giggling and gossiping, sipping on cans of Diet Coke and chatting as they waited their turns. Some were as young as fourteen and still had prepubescent, almost boyish figures. Indeed, aside from the supermodels, many models are surprisingly plain without makeup. They are chameleons that designers can transform into the type of women they want to project that season.<br><br>Against one wall stood a line of vanity tables, outfitted with bright klieg lights and littered with bottles, tubes, and hairpieces. Makeup artists held the girls&#x2019; chins firmly, turning their heads left and right to get a good look at their work. The room grew stifling with the sickly smell of hair spray, cigarette smoke, and espresso vapors. Because the show was just a one-night stand and not part of a fashion marathon, the hair and makeup people had a relatively easy time of it. During fashion week, when the girls scurry from show to show, the hair and makeup artists have to rush to remove the fake nails, elaborate hairdos, or full-body bronzing gel that the last designer demanded. A model who works the whole five-week runway season will find her skin, hair, and nails wrecked by the relentless grooming.<br>Once made up, the bare-breasted models stripped down to just heels and tiny G-strings, their Brazilian bikini waxes on full display, and waited for dressers to help them wiggle into the clothes without smudging their makeup or leaving stains on the dresses from the greasy lotion they&#x2019;d applied to their legs to make them shine under the lights. Models often crash-dieted or downed laxatives before a big show, so Versace&#x2019;s motherly seamstresses, pins hanging from their mouths, stood ready to nip and tuck dresses to make them fit again. Double-sided tape was strapped to the models&#x2019; breasts to keep them from popping out of Versace&#x2019;s signature plunging necklines on stage. Trays of food sat untouched.<br><br>Donatella&#x2019;s assistants then took Polaroid shots of each woman in her assigned dress, complete with any jewelry and handbags she would wear for the show. The photos were then taped to a rack holding the entire outfit, so that the models wouldn&#x2019;t forget anything. Donatella was watching a seamstress fit a model into a dress, mulling some last-minute changes to the lineup, when her cell phone rang. Of course, it was Gianni, calling from Miami Beach to pepper her with questions.</p><h2>Manhattan Transfer</h2><p>The classic depiction of a city&#39;s struggle to embrace modernity or risk being destroyed by it.</p><p>10 1.5-hour cassettesJohn Dos Passos (1896-1970), a member of the Lost Generation, was the author of more than forty works of fiction and nonfiction, including THREE SOLDIERS and MANHATTAN TRANSFER.</p><h2>Cheesecakes (Philadelphia Cream Cheese)</h2><p>&#x201c;This is a beautiful book &#x2014; essential reading for anyone who loves animals and knows how much they can teach us about being human.&#x201d; &#x2015; Gwen Cooper, author of "Homer&#x2019;s Odyssey: CK-4</p><p></p><h2>The Official Pocket Guide to Diabetic Exchanges: Choose Your Foods</h2><p>Completely updated to match the newest edition of <i>Choose Your Foods: Exchange Lists for Diabetes Meal Planning</i>, this pocket-sized bestseller is now better and more complete than ever.<br><br>Every day and at every meal, millions of people use the exchange list system to help them plan their meal, choose the healthiest foods, and estimate the right portions.

Her life was one of passion and determination, of suffering and hope, but ultimately it is a tragic love story, as circumstances conspired against her. Having lost her first husband, Henry's elder brother Prince Arthur, she endured years of ill health and penury, to make a dazzling second match in Henry VIII. There is no doubt that she was Henry's true love, compatible with him in every respect and, for years, she presided over a majestic court as the personification of his ideal woman.However, Catherine&#x2019;s body failed her in an age when fertility was a prerequisite of political stability. When it became clear that she could no longer bear children, the king&#x2019;s attention turned elsewhere, and his once chivalric devotion became resentment. Catherine&#x2019;s final years were spent in lonely isolation but she never gave up her vision: she was devoted to her faith, her husband and to England, to the extent that she was prepared to be martyred for them. Banished and close to death, she wrote a final letter to her &#x2018;most dear lord and husband&#x2019;. &#x2018;I pardon you everything... mine eyes desire you above all things.&#x2019; The fidelity of this remarkable woman never wavered.</p><p>Amy Licence has been a teacher for over a decade.

The gravestones stood dark and unreadable in the shadows of the high rock walls of St. Michael's Church.<br><br>Gowned in layers of heavy black crepe, her face hidden beneath the veil of a wide-brimmed black bonnet, Coralee Whitmore stood next to her father and mother, the Viscount and Viscountess of Selkirk, listening to the drone of the bishop's words but not really hearing them.<br><br>In the casket beside a mound of damp earth, her sister's body lay cold and pale, retrieved only days ago from the chilly waters of the Avon River, the victim of a suicide, the authorities claimed. Laurel, they said, had jumped into the river to hide her shame.<br><br>"You're shivering." A stiff wind ruffled the viscount's copper hair, the same fiery shade as Coralee's. He was a man of average height and build whose imposing presence made him seem much larger. "The bishop has finished. It is time we went home."<br><br>Corrie stared at the casket, then down at the long-stemmed white rose she carried in a black-gloved hand. Tears blurred her vision as she moved forward, her legs stiff and numb beneath her heavy black skirt, the veil on her hat fluttering in the cold February breeze. She laid the rose on top of the rosewood casket.<br><br>"I don't believe it," she whispered to the sister she would never see again. "Not for a single moment." Corrie swallowed against the painful, choking knot in her throat.<br><br>"Farewell, sweet sister. I shall miss you ever so much." Turning, she walked toward her parents, the father both sisters shared and the mother who was Corrie's alone.<br><br>Laurel's mother had died in childbirth. The viscount had remarried, and Corrie had been born soon after. The girls were half sisters, raised together, always close, at least until the past few years. Then Corrie's job as society editor for Heart to Heart, a London ladies' gazette, had begun to absorb more and more of her time.<br><br>Laurel, who had always preferred the quiet life of the country, had moved in with her aunt Agnes at Selkirk Hall, the family estate in Wiltshire. The girls kept in touch through letters, but in the last year even those had grown sparse.<br><br>If only I could turn back time, Corrie thought, the lump in her throat swelling, becoming even more painful. If only I could have been there when you needed me.<br><br>But she had been too busy with her own life, too busy attending the balls and soirï¿½es she wrote about in her column. She'd been too self-absorbed to realize Laurel was in trouble.<br><br>And now her sister was dead. <br><br>* * *<br><br> "Are you all right, Coralee?"<br><br>Standing in the Blue Salon of the Whitmores' Grosvenor Square mansion, Corrie turned at the sound of her best friend's voice. Krista Hart Draugr walked toward her across the drawing room, where the pale blue damask curtains had been draped with black crepe, as had the brocade sofa and Hepplewhite chairs.<br><br>Corrie reached beneath her heavy black veil to brush a tear from her cheek. "I'll be all right. But I miss her already and I feel so...responsible."<br><br>Most of the mourners, few in number because of the circumstances of Laurel's death, were in the Cinnamon Room, a lavish salon done in gold and umber, with huge, sienna marble fireplaces at each end. An extravagant buffet had been set out for the guests, but Corrie had no heart for food.<br><br>"It wasn't your fault, Coralee. You had no idea your sister was in trouble." Krista was blond, fair and tall; taller, in fact, than most men, except for her husband, Leif, a blond giant of a man who towered over his wife and actually made her look small.<br><br>One of the handsomest men Corrie had ever seen, he stood across the drawing room in conversation with his brother, Thor, who was dark instead of fair, nearly equal in size and, in a fiercer way, even more handsome.<br><br>"I should have grown suspicious when her letters dwindled to nearly nothing," Corrie said. "I should have known something was wrong."<br><br>"She was twenty-three, Coralee. That is two years older than you, and she was very independent. And she wrote you from Norfolk, as I recall."<br><br>Last summer, Laurel had traveled to East Dereham in Norfolk to live with her other aunt, Gladys. Along with Allison, a cousin about Corrie's age, they were the only relatives on her mother's side that Laurel had. Laurel had never gotten along with Corrie's mother, but her aunts, both spinsters, loved her like a daughter, and Laurel had loved them.<br><br>"She wrote to me from Norfolk, yes, but only on rare occasions. We had just resumed a serious correspondence last month, after her return to Selkirk Hall."<br><br>According to the Wiltshire County constable, when Laurel was in residence at Selkirk, she had gotten herself with child. Agnes had kept Laurel's secret until her pregnancy began to show, then sent her north to live with Gladys until the baby was born.<br><br>Corrie looked up at Krista, who stood a good six inches taller than she, a buxom young woman with lovely blue eyes, while Corrie was small-boned, with eyes a vivid shade of green. Krista was a mother now, but she still ran the gazette, a magazine for ladies that was well known for its views on social reform.<br><br>"The police believe she committed suicide," Corrie said.<br><br>"They say she took the child she had carried in her womb for nine long months and jumped into the river because she couldn't bear the shame. I don't believe it. Not for a moment. My sister would never harm anyone, much less her own baby."<br><br>Krista's gaze held a trace of pity. "I know you loved her, Corrie, but even if you are right, there is nothing you can do."<br><br>Corrie ignored the feeling those words stirred. "Perhaps not."<br><br>But she wasn't completely convinced.<br><br>She had been thinking about the circumstances of her sister's death since news of the tragedy had arrived&#x2014;her sister drowned, remnants of an infant's blue knit sweater clutched in her hand.<br><br>Corrie had been devastated. She loved her older sister. She couldn't imagine a world without her in it.<br><br>Dreadful things were being said about Laurel but Corrie refused to believe them. Laurel's death could not possibly have been suicide.<br><br>In time, surely the truth would be unearthed.<br><br>London<br><br>Three Months Later<br><br>The offices of Heart to Heart weekly ladies' magazine were located in a narrow brick building just off Piccadilly. Corrie had begun working at the gazette shortly after Margaret Chapman Hart had died and her daughter, Krista, had taken over the business, running the company along with her father, Professor Sir Paxton Hart. Last year, Krista had married Leif Draugr, now the owner of a successful shipping enterprise, and nine months later had borne him a son, but Krista still worked most days at Heart to Heart, her pride and passion.<br><br>As Corrie entered the office in search of her friend, she spotted Bessie Briggs, the typesetter, working to get the big Stanhope press, the soul of the gazette, ready for the next edition. Bessie looked up and smiled but kept on working, paying no attention to the dismal black mourning clothes Corrie had worn for the past three months and would wear for three months more.<br><br>Corrie tapped on the open door to Krista's ground floor office.<br><br>Her friend looked up and smiled. "Since you rarely knock, I assume this must be important. Come in, Coralee."<br><br>Her stiff black skirts rustled noisily as Corrie moved to close the door behind her. "I have something I need to discuss, and since you are my very best friend..."<br><br>Krista eyed her with speculation. "What is it?" Corrie sat down and smoothed a nonexistent wrinkle from the front of her skirt. "I've tried to put Laurel's death behind me, but the fact is, I simply cannot. I have to find out the truth, Krista. I've never believed Laurel killed herself and her month-old child, and I am going to prove it."<br><br>Krista's features softened. "I know losing your sister has been hard on you. I know that in some way you feel responsible. But Laurel is gone and there is nothing you can do to bring her back."<br><br>"I realize that. But I failed her once when she needed me, and I will not do so again. My sister did not kill herself, which means someone else must have done it, and I intend to discover who it was."<br><br>One of Krista's blond eyebrows arched. "And how, exactly, do you plan to do that?"<br><br>"I shall start by doing some investigating right here in London. I am good at that, am I not? It is part of my job to unearth both facts and tidbits of gossip for my column."<br><br>"Yes, but that is hardly the same."<br><br>"I think it is exactly the same. I intend to go over every letter my sister wrote before she died and look for clues." Corrie glanced up, a fierce light coming into her eyes.<br><br>"Then I shall leave for the country. I'm going to find out who fathered Laurel's child, and then I will know where to start looking for the answers to how and why she died."<br><br>Learning the name of the father was an important piece of the puzzle, the man her sister must have loved. Not even Aunt Agnes knew who he was. According to her, Laurel had adamantly refused to divulge his identity.<br><br>"You don't need to worry about the gazette," Corrie continued before Krista could speak. "I already have a temporary replacement in mind. Assuming you approve, I shall ask Lindsey Graham to fill in for me while I am away." Lindsey was a school chum, a former classmate at Briarhill Academy, where Krista and Corrie had met.<br><br>"Lindsay is currently penning textbook articles," Corrie said, "and extremely bored, I think. Her father is a baron and very well connected so she is able to move freely about in society. I believe she will handle my job very well."<br><br>"I imagine she could, but&#x2014;"<br><br>"Actually, I considered hiring Lindsey while you and Leif were gone off to his dreadful island." Corrie smiled.<br><br>"Running this place without you was a nearly impossible task. I have never been so happy in my life to see anyone return."<br><br>Leif and Krista's story was a well-guarded tale. That the big man and his brother had come from an uncharted island far north of Scotland where people still lived as Vikings was, at best, totally incredible and better left unsaid.<br><br>All that mattered was that Leif had found Krista and she had found him, and they loved each other desperately. Corrie wondered if the right man would ever come along for her.<br><br>Which returned her thoughts to her sister. In Laurel's early letters from Selkirk, she had mentioned meeting a man. She had described his many virtues and said how much she enjoyed his company. Corrie intended to review the letters, see if there might be a description, something that might help her find out his name. Who had stolen Laurel's heart, taken her virtue, then abandoned her?<br><br>Corrie wondered if the man who had fathered Laurel's child would have gone so far as to murder them.<br><br>"You can't be serious, Coralee. Tell me you do not intend to dredge up this painful affair all over again." Agnes Hatfield sat on the rose velvet settee in a small salon near the back of the Whitmores'town mansion, a room done in white and rose, an elegant, feminine salon that overlooked the garden. Three days ago, the black crepe strung round the room had been removed after three long months of mourning.<br><br>"I realize it will take some doing, Aunt Agnes, but I have given the matter considerable thought and I have no choice but to act."<br><br>Aunt Agnes, which Corrie had always called her though they were not actually blood-related, was a lady in her sixties, plump and silver-haired, and until the death of her beloved niece, always smiling. Seated next to her, Laurel's cousin, Allison Hatfield, a thin young woman with a razor-straight nose and pointed chin, very dark hair and hazel eyes, listened to Corrie with obvious trepidation. Allison's parents had died of cholera, leaving her in the care of her aging aunt.<br><br>At the viscount's invitation, both of the women had elected to remain in the city rather than return to Selkirk Hall and the awful memories the place still held for them.<br><br>"So you intend to begin some sort of investigation?" Aunt Agnes asked.<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>Allison made no comment. She was a shy, unobtrusive young woman rarely inclined to disagree with anything anyone said. Which was perhaps the reason she had agreed to leave East Dereham and accompany Laurel on her return to Selkirk Hall, pretending to be the baby's mother.<br><br>Or perhaps it was because Allison was tired of scraping by on her aging aunt Gladys's generosity, and Laurel had promised her a goodly sum and a better future in exchange for her help with the child.<br><br>"I do not believe for an instant the authorities' version of what occurred," Corrie said, "and after months of consideration, I have decided to act. I plan to take whatever steps are necessary to discover the truth of what happened to my sister. Aunt Agnes, you and Gladys helped Laurel. Now you must help me find out what happened to her and her baby."<br><br>Allison pulled a lace-trimmed handkerchief from her reticule and dabbed at her eyes. She had been as fond of Laurel and her month-old infant, Joshua Michael, as Agnes, who also dug out an embroidered square of cotton and blew her powdered nose.<br><br>The older woman took a fortifying breath. "I will help in any way I can...though perhaps my helping your sister is what, in the end, got her killed."<br><br>Corrie's eyes widened. "So you do not believe it was suicide, either! And if she did not take her own life, someone must have killed her. Laurel and the child were victims of foul play. It is the only explanation."<br><br>From her place on the rose velvet settee, Allison's soft voice whispered across the room. "There is a chance...I cannot say for certain...but it is possible that Laurel may have been meeting someone the night she disappeared. She wouldn't tell me where she was going, but she was excited. I didn't realize she had taken the baby until later, when I went into the nursery and saw his cradle was empty."<br><br>Corrie felt a rush of sadness that brought the sting of tears. She purposely leaned into the stiff bone stays of her corset, and the tiny jolt of discomfort set her back on course. "Please...we must try to stay focused."<br><br></p><h2>Crochet a Zoo: Fun Toys for Baby and You</h2><p><p>Go a little wild as you stitch everything from lions and tigers to bears and baboons.

In the summer of 1947, the frontier between India and its newly-created neighbor, Pakistan, had become a river of blood, as the post-Partition exodus across the border erupted into violent rioting. In Train to Pakistan, truth meets fiction with stunning impact, as Khushwant Singh recounts the trauma and tragedy of Partition through the stories of his charactersstories that he, his family and friends themselves experienced or saw enacted before their eyes. Sixty years later, in an age where these tensions still lie close to the surface, Bourk-Whites photographs of the Partition illustrate Khushwant Singhs prose with a stark and almost unbearably heart-rending subtext.</p><p>It is a place, Khushwant Singh goes on to tell us at the beginning of this classic novel, where Sikhs and Muslims have lived together in peace for hundreds of years. Then one day, at the end of the summer, the &#39;ghost train&#39; arrives, a silent, incredible funeral train loaded with the bodies of thousands of refuges, bringing the village its first taste of the horrors of the civil war.

But what began then as an apprenticeship at La Varenne Ecole de Cuisine evolved into a lifelong immersion in French cuisine and culture, culminating in permanent residency in 1994. <b>On Rue Tatin</b> chronicles her journey to an ancient little street in Louviers, one of Normandy&#x2019;s most picturesque towns.<br><br>With lyrical prose and wry candor, Loomis recalls the miraculous restoration that she and her husband performed on the dilapidated convent they chose for their new residence. As its ochre and azure floor tiles emerged, challenges outside the dwelling mounted. From squatters to a surly priest next door, along with a close-knit community wary of outsiders, Loomis tackled the social challenges head-on, through persistent dialogue&#x2014;and baking.<br><br>As fresh ingredients abound in this rural haven, along with a reverence for the kitchen, <b>On Rue Tatin</b><i> </i>includes delicious recipes that evoke the essence of this region, such as Apple and Thyme Tart and main courses including Duck Breast with Cider and Braised Chicken in White Wine and Mustard.<br><br>Transporting readers to a world whose cobblestone lanes shirk commercialism in favor of cherished tradition, <b>On Rue Tatin</b> provides a touching glimpse of the camaraderie, exquisite food, and simple pleasures of daily life in this truly glorious corner of Normandy.</p><p>It has been said that food defines a culture. For the French, food is an integral part of their coveted tradition, and Susan Herrmann Loomis's new book <i>On Rue Tatin</i> embraces both. As a young, recent American college graduate, Loomis left the U.S. for France to attend one of the oldest French cooking schools, La Varenne. Her intent was to immerse herself in French cooking with the aspiration of becoming a food critic. Working as the French equivalent of an apprentice, she quickly became intimate with the ways and traditions that define the French culture, specifically its cuisine. <i>On Rue Tatin</i> ("On Tatin Street") is a descriptive narrative of Loomis's first several years in France, her encounters with the local people, and the bonds she formed, as well as recipes she gathered during her time there.<p> Following her formal culinary training, Loomis returned to the U.S. and met the man who would become her husband. After the couple's first son turned 2, they moved to France where Loomis was determined to launch her writing career focusing on unique aspects of French farming cuisine. She and her husband eventually purchased an old monastery in Louviers in the Normandy region of France. One of the more humorous and memorable stories she shares concerns the landlord of the small rental that they occupied for a year while her husband remodeled the monastery to livable conditions. During that year, the wife of the landlord believed them to be CIA agents and chose to keep a cold distance from the family. Meanwhile the French police suspected them of dealing drugs.</p><p> Every recipe featured throughout this memoir comes with an interesting, anecdotal story, and is very much representative of traditional French cuisine. Gateau au Chocolat de Mamy (or Mamy Jacqueline's Chocolate Cake) is a dense, almost death-by-chocolate confection, but served alone or with a fresh fruit coulis, it will bring a smile, as will the sweet explanation of its origin.</p><p> Loomis describes experiences and people with much detail, sometimes several times over, and her prose allows the reader to imagine the tempting smells and vivid colors of the countryside. You may find yourself wishing to see pictures of Loomis's home and the quaint village where she lived, but perhaps that was Loomis's intent--she wants to tempt and challenge you to experience the beauty and foods of Louviers and the Normandy region for yourself. <i>--Teresa Simanton</i></p>Advance praise for <b>On Rue Tatin</b><i>:<br><br></i>"Where many American writers merely love France, Susan Loomis knows it: its smells and people and manners. Her cookbooks have always been especially well-written, and, in <b>On Rue Tatin</b>, her first book where there is more writing than cooking, she shows that she is as natural a writer as she is a chef." --Adam Gopnik, author of<b> Paris to the Moon<br><br></b>"Susan Loomis's homey French kitchen is one of my favorite places in the whole wide world. If you love food, love France, and dream about living there, you must read <b>On Rue Tatin</b>."<br>--Barbara Tropp, author of <b>China Moon<br><br></b>"When Susan Loomis went to France 20 years ago she was impressed, just as I was, with the beauty and aliveness of French food. What a pleasure to be seduced with her delightful stories and taken into a kitchen filled with the irresistible tastes and aromas of Normandy."<br>--Alice Waters, author of <b>Chez Panisse Cafe Cookbook</b><i><br><br></i>"Susan's charming tale of living and working in France is just like her recipes: delicious, sometimes surprising, and always satisfying." --Johanne Killeen and George Germon, authors of <b>Cucina Simpatica: Robust Trattoria Cooking<br></b><i><br></i>"In this, her most personal book, Susan Loomis shares with us her rich family life, a world of amazing French friendships, and proves, most of all, that each and every dream CAN come true!" --Patricia Wells, author of <b>Patricia Wells at Home in Provence</b><br><br>"Susan Loomis has written a radiant love letter to France-particularly Normandy-its countryside, food, markets, and people.

His tomb is the most visited Catholic shrine anywhere, drawing more devotees than Lourdes. His miraculous feats included the ability to fly and to be present in two places at once; an apparition of Padre Pio in midair prevented Allied warplanes from dropping bombs on his hometown. Most notable of all were his stigmata, which provoke heated controversy to this day. Were they truly God-given? A psychosomatic response to extreme devotion? Or, perhaps, the self-inflicted wounds of a charlatan?</p><p>Now acclaimed historian Sergio Luzzatto offers a pioneering investigation of this remarkable man and his followers. Neither a worshipful hagiography nor a sensationalist exposï¿½, <i>Padre Pio</i> is a nuanced examination of the persistence of mysticism in contemporary society and a striking analysis of the links between Catholicism and twentieth-century politics. Granted unprecedented access to the Vatican archives, Luzzatto has also unearthed a letter from Padre Pio himself in which the monk asks for a secret delivery of carbolic acid&#x2014;a discovery which helps explain why two successive popes regarded Padre Pio as a fraud, until pressure from Pio-worshipping pilgrims forced the Vatican to change its views.</p><p>A profoundly original tale of wounds and wonder, salvation and swindle, <i>Padre Pio</i> explores what it really means to be a saint in our time.</p></p><p><p>Sergio Luzzatto is the author of numerous books on French and Italian history, including <i>The Body of Il Duce: Mussolini&#x2019;s Corpse and the Fortunes of Italy</i>. He is a professor of modern history at the University of Turin, Italy, and a regular contributor to the leading Italian daily <i>Il Sole 24 Ore</i>.</p><p>Prologue: September 20, 1918</p><p>For a Capuchin friar hidden away in the half-empty San Giovanni Rotondo monastery on the remote Gargano Peninsula in southern Italy, September 20, 1918, was a fateful day. Around nine that morning, while Padre Pio of Pietrelcina was praying before a crucifix in the monastery chapel, "a mysterious personage" materialized before him, a figure bleeding from his hands, his feet, and his side. Alarmed, the thirty-one-year-old priest begged for God's assistance. The figure disappeared immediately, but Padre Pio's alarm only grew when he saw that Jesus's stigmata were now visible on his own body. "I look at my hands, feet and side and see they are wounded and blood is pouring out," he wrote to his spiritual adviser.1 "All my innards are bloody and my eye must resign itself to watch the blood gushing out," so much of it that "I fear I will bleed to death."2</p><p>Over the next ninety years, the minuscule Capuchin monastery in San Giovanni Rotondo would become a leading place of pilgrimage in Europe, as crowded with worshippers as Santiago, Lourdes, Fatima, or Medjugorje. Padre Pio would become the most venerated saint in twenty-first-century Italy, more popular than St. Anthony of Padua and St. Francis of Assisi, more popular even than the Virgin Mary or Jesus of Nazareth.3 And questions about the meaning&#x2014;if there was one&#x2014;that the Lord intended to transmit to mankind with the friar's five stigmata would trouble believers and nonbelievers alike.</p><p>Was the Capuchin friar from this remote corner of Puglia a holy man capable of inspiring other Catholics? Was he a throwback to an archaic version of faith untenable in the twentieth century? Was he merely a fraud? Authorities within the Church and outside it, high prelates and clever con men, leading intellectuals and committed Fascists would all take sides on the matter. The Holy Office&#x2014;what was once called the Inquisition&#x2014;would ponder the matter of Padre Pio's legitimacy at length. This book is one historian's attempt to disentangle the skeins of old and new, of sacred and profane, that made Padre Pio a twentieth-century legend.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Padre Pio's stigmata did not appear at just any moment. Although the friar had long been telling his superiors that Christ's Passion was renewing itself in his body,4 the timing of the event was powerfully cued to the public sphere. The autumn of 1918 was a special moment in collective awareness, a time heavily in need of the sacred. The immense trauma of the Great War&#x2014;a war so unbearable that everywhere around Italy there abounded rumors of young maidens with mysterious powers to end the fighting5&#x2014;had ripened into the conviction that the conflict was a never-ending crucifixion, in which the soldiers' unspeakable suffering would providentially save mankind.6 The equally unspeakable suffering of the soldiers' mothers was likewise represented by the figure of the <i>Mater dolorosa</i>, the Holy Mother holding the dead Christ in her arms in the supreme act of grief.7</p><p>The ultranationalist Italian poet Gabriele D'Annunzio captured this theme of the soldier as Christ, the war as his Passion, in his <i>Songs of the Latin War</i>, which was crammed with biblical citations.8 And it was not only poets who took to interpreting the war in Christian terms. Deep in the trenches, the rude material world of the soldiers teemed with crosses, nails, and crucifixes; between the boom of the cannons and the blast of the grenades, Jesus was ever-present in an immediate, ambiguous set of symbols.9 Was this an end or a rebirth, destruction or resurrection? Trench warfare had confounded the very notions of life and death.10 Soldiers at the front had an obsessive fear of being buried alive; they had recurrent fantasies of being the living dead. The Italian poet Clemente Rebora thought that the Great War had begotten a new existential dimension, <i>vitamorte</i>, "death-in-life."11 All across Europe, millions of disfigured and wounded veterans testified to that condition, men upon whose faces and bodies devastating military technology had impressed its indelible mark, the cruel stigmata of modernity.12 After the war, some of these men would brandish their injuries like patriotic slogans. In Italy, their ranks included wounded veterans like Giuseppe Caradonna and Carlo Delcroix, soon to be leading Fascists.</p><p>Padre Pio's wounds, meanwhile, had no patriotic significance. Although the Capuchin friar was enrolled as a soldier-priest, he managed to live out the entire conflict far from the front lines. Nevertheless, some of the words he wrote in autumn 1918 curiously echo the thoughts of the trench fighters. In November, just after the victory of Vittorio Veneto, Padre Pio wrote to his spiritual adviser that he considered himself among the "living dead."13 In a sense, he too counted himself a survivor of the greatest of wars. In the inferno of the Dolomites trenches and on the cruel heights of the Carso, Italian soldiers had won their battle against the Teutonic devil, but they had been scarred in body and in spirit. And in the inferno of a monastery cell in Puglia, the Capuchin friar had won his battle with Satan, but he too had been wounded, in spirit and in body.</p><p>Of course, the wounds of the veterans were different from those of Padre Pio. The first were metaphorical stigmata: they were the "tattoos" that the Great War had inscribed on an entire generation, as one war-wounded poet, Nicola Moscardelli, so memorably put it.14 The second were literal stigmata, the marks that the Lord had placed on one specific individual. From metaphorical stigmata, only profane happenings could come. Padre Pio's literal stigmata promised amazing, sacred developments.</p><p>The Great War was not the only affliction that set the stage for the dramatic events in the remote Capuchin monastery. As the summer of 1918 drew to a close, a new horror arose: the "Spanish" flu, which began its grim harvest in August and which in just seven months would kill more Italians than all of World War I.15 While the war had decimated the men, the <i>spagnola</i> attacked mostly women, particularly where hygiene and nutrition were poor. Among these places was Puglia, and especially the province of Foggia. There, in the town of San Giovanni Rotondo, home to fewer than ten thousand people, some two hundred died between September and October 1918.16</p><p>Padre Pio thus received his stigmata as death was knocking on the doors of San Giovanni Rotondo, of the Gargano Peninsula, of Puglia, of Italy, and of Europe. It was a moment when believers everywhere were saying heartfelt prayers for clemency and protection. Of course, a man of God could try the argument used by one priest in a ravaged Veneto town, who told his faithful that death had come because "the Carnival went on too long, so now perhaps we'll have a long Lent."17 Still, as the war drew to an end, Christian men and women could reasonably expect something more than the usual moralizing. As good Christians, they could hope that some exceptional individual&#x2014;a saint&#x2014;would come along to rescue them from all the evil in their midst: from disease, from destitution, from grief. They might even, as in other apocalyptic moments in the history of Christianity,18 convince themselves that the Lord had made himself flesh a second time, so that sinning humanity could once again be redeemed.</p><p>The unknown friar in his Gargano monastery who, praying one morning, receives the five wounds of Christ on his body must therefore be situated in the spiritual climate of Italy and Europe at the end of the&nbsp;war's slaughter and the epidemic's devastation. Many centuries earlier, the arrival of the Black Death had stirred a kind of faith that was more anxious than before, more impatient and imploring.19 Something like this, too, happened after the Great War when Padre Pio's fame as a holy man began to spread.20 From the point of view of the friar and his superiors, the stigmata were merely the last step in a mystical journey that he had embarked on years before. From the point of view of the war-weary faithful, however, the stigmata were of immediate import, and it would not be long before crowds appeared at the friar's door.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Saints exist mainly to perform miracles.21 The story of Padre Pio cannot escape being, among other things, a history of these miracles&#x2014;the healings, the apparitions, the conversions. Telling it requires approaching these events as an anthropologist would, making no distinctions between reality and myth&#x2014;or perhaps the way that medieval historians, those professional agnostics, would do it.22 Let me be clear right away that this study does not intend to establish once and for all whether Padre Pio's wounds were <i>genuine</i> stigmata, or whether the works he did&nbsp;were <i>genuine</i> miracles. All those seeking answers&#x2014;affirmative or negative&#x2014;as to whether the stigmata or the miracles were "real" had better close this book right now. Padre Pio's stigmata and his miracles interest us less for what they tell us about him than for what they tell us about the world around him: the many-colored world of priests and friars, of clerics and laymen, of believers and atheists, of the cultivated and the unlettered, of the good and the bad and the shrewd and the simple, of those who believed in the stigmata and the miracles and of those who refused to believe. Sainthood is a social custom made up of rites of interaction; saints matter as much for how they appear as for what they are.23</p><p>It is not easy to find the appropriate way to tell Padre Pio's story, and that helps to explain why there exists no proper historical study of the man that the Italian newspaper <i>Il Manifesto</i> once called, half seriously, "the most important Italian of the twentieth century."24 There are, of course, countless hagiographies of Padre Pio,25 all of them utterly lacking a critical perspective (though two French biographies and one by an American, written in a devout spirit, do provide some useful documentation).26 There are also several good works of cultural anthropology and religious sociology on the "Padre Pio phenomenon," the cult that exploded in the later years of his life and in the decades after his death.27 But no historian has ever written about the world of Padre Pio, almost as if there were something shameful about elevating the friar and his followers to the level of historic actors. Apparently what scholars of the Middle Ages take for granted&#x2014;that studying beliefs is not the same as being a naive believer oneself&#x2014;remains to be accepted by scholars who deal with the present.</p><p>At the close of the nineteenth century, secular intellectuals hurriedly proclaimed the end of religion and the disenchantment of the world. Yet today, a century later, a deep need to find some transcendent poetry in prosaic everyday life is still evident all around us. Were it not so, twentieth-century popular religiosity might simply be dismissed as the sad relic of an all-but-extinct sensibility. But secularism hasn't destroyed religion, because political, cultural, and scientific progress has not eliminated the dimension of evil from our lives, nor the need, for many, to see misfortune as part of a providential plan. The story of Padre Pio cannot be understood without keeping in mind the shrewd observation once made by writer and politician Ignazio Silone: having a labor union doesn't mean you can do without the saints, because "the poor are always afraid."28 Especially among the most humble, material progress does not destroy piety, that is, the spiritual need for reassurance and the wish to be protected.</p><p>But Padre Pio's story also cannot be seen simply as part of a long continuity, as if a man could be a saint in the twentieth century in the same way as in the Middle Ages. The stakes of sainthood have changed. As long as Christian faith was unquestioned, the portentous methods&#x2014;mysterious healings, bodily marks, celestial apparitions&#x2014;by which the divine appeared to man were seen as <i>signs</i> of the existence of God, and theologists, notaries, and doctors could debate their authenticity without shaking the whole house of the Christian supernatural.29 Even the detractors of St. Francis in the thirteenth century, for example, could doubt that his human wounds were the true stigmata of Christ's divinity without in any way bringing into question the message of the Savior.30 But in the contemporary era, once Christian faith became a choice, the same portentous events started to be seen as something more: they became <i>proof</i> of the existence of God.31 Those who questioned whether Padre Pio's stigmata were divine were often ready to reject Christianity altogether, while those who saw his stigmata as a fresh revelation of Christ were emboldened in their faith, ready to proclaim to all the world that the crucifixion was still very much alive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A story of piety must necessarily also be a story of impiety&#x2014;of execration, blasphemy, and just plain denial.32 To reconstruct Padre Pio's tale and that of his advocates we must also tell the story of his opponents, who didn't hesitate to speak up soon after the events of September 20, 1918. There were some secular adversaries, obviously: skeptics and anticlericals, liberals and socialists. But also, and above all, Padre Pio had his clerical adversaries. Men of religious orders and not, modest church officials and powerful Vatican insiders&#x2014;they ranged across twentieth-century Italian Catholicism's many worlds and its many kinds of faith.33</p><p>For some fifty years, until his death in 1968, Padre Pio never moved from San Giovanni Rotondo. His material horizons coincided with those of the monastery where he took shelter during World War I and where he earned the terrible prize of the stigmata. But while Padre Pio&nbsp;did not move, all around him men of the church did. They acted from far and near, by choice or out of duty. Among those who came to concern themselves with the Capuchin friar were Cardinal Pietro Gasparri and Father Agostino Gemelli, Pope Pius XI and Pius XII, Don Luigi Orione and Don Ernesto Buonaiuti, Pope John XXIII and John Paul II. In a twentieth-century Church still brooding over the humiliating fall of the Papal States in 1870 and vowing a Catholic <i>reconquista</i> of Italian society, both Padre Pio's opponents, like Father Gemelli, and his advocates, like Pius XII, were mindful of the humble friar's role in that fateful historical battle. Measuring themselves against Padre Pio, leading men of the Church also had to face tough questions about the material nature of faith, about the proper limits of pastoral duty, about the direct or indirect routes to sainthood.</p><p>And behind these was a question even more serious and troubling: could a good Christian ever accept the existence of an <i>alter Christus</i>, a living Christ figure? Didn't even contemplating such a possibility suggest that Jesus's Incarnation and his Passion had only partially redeemed mankind, that there might be more chapters still to come in the story of salvation?34 Though St. Francis's contemporaries had also faced this problem, it became more complicated in Padre Pio's case.35 St.&nbsp;Francis had received the stigmata near the end of his life, and he had kept them hidden; Padre Pio, on the other hand, was young when the wounds appeared, and he woul...</p></p><h2>The Hole in the Dike (A Blue Ribbon Book)</h2><p>A retelling of the familiar story, originally by Mary Mapes Dodge, about the little Dutch boy who saves his country&#39;s fields and homes from the sea</p><p></p><h2>The Flame Trees of Thika: Memories of an African Childhood</h2><p>She left the misty shores of England for an Eden in Africa A Penquin Book 2nd printing 1982</p><p><b>Elspeth Huxley</b> was born in 1907 and spent most of her childhood in Kenya. She wrote novels, detective fiction, biographies, and travel books. She died in 1997.In 1913, at the age of six, Elspeth Huxley accompanied her parents from England to their recently acquired land in Kenya, "a bit of El Dorado my father had been fortunate enough to buy in the bar of the Norfolk hotel from a man wearing an Old Etonian tie." The land is not nearly what its seller claimed, but Elspeth's parents are undaunted and begin their coffee plantation. Her mother, a resourceful, adventurous woman, "eager always to extract from every moment its last drop of interest or pleasure," keeps an eye on Elspeth's education but also allows her extensive freedom. Through Elspeth Huxley's marvelous gift for description, early twentieth-century Kenya comes alive with all the excitement and naive insight of a child who watches with eyes wide open as coffee trees are planted, buffaloes are skinned, pythons are disemboweled, and cultures collide with all the grace of runaway trains. With a free-wheeling imagination and a dry wit, she describes the interactions of Kikuyus, Masais, Dutch Boers, Brits and Scots, mixing rapid-fire descriptions with philosophical musings. It is a mixture that suits her land of contrasts and unknowns, where vastly different peoples live and work side by side but rarely come together, like an egg beater whose "the two arms whirled independently and never touched, so that perhaps one arm never knew the other was there; yet they were together, turned by the same handle, and the cake was mixed by both." <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Erica Bauermeister</i></p><h2>Snow White, Blood Red</h2><p><p><i></i></p><i>Once upon a time, fairy tales <br>were for children . . .

No longer are transference and countertransference considered to have meaning (as concepts or as experiences) except in relation to one another; each is the context in which the other is generated and understood. In the course of this discussion, Ogden introduces the idea of the "intersubjective analytic third" in his effort to conceptualize the interdependence of subject and object, of transference and countertransference, in the analytic process.<br><br>This book offers a way of understanding and making use of a critical dimension of the analytic experience that is rarely spoken about by psychotherapists and analysts, and even less frequently written about in the analytic literature: the ordinary, moment-to-moment experience of the analyst in the analytic setting, including his most mundane thoughts about the minutiae of his "outside life," his obsessional ruminations, daydreams, sexual fantasies, distractedness, bodily sensations and worries, and so on. This highly personal, very ordinary, almost invisible aspect of the analyst's experience in the consulting room is viewed as having been created freshly as an analytic object in the unique context of the analytic relationship as it has developed to that moment of the analysis. Too often, this sort of experience has been dismissed as "the analyst's own stuff" that must be filtered as extraneous "psychological noise." For Ogden, this mundane/personal background of analytic experience is seen as an important manifestation of the analyst's experience in the intersubjective analytic third to which the analyst must attempt to gain conscious access and must learn to utilize in the formulation of his interpretations and other forms of intervention.</p><p>&#34;Thomas Ogden has already achieved a reputation as a gifted contributor to the psychoanalytic literature. His ability to integrate the complexities of object relations theory and to innovate upon them with such rare creativity has long been recognized internationally. In his latest work, Subjects of Analysis, he transcends this reputation. &#34;Intersubjectivity has recently become a new flash word for many analysts of different schools for attempting to transcend the limitations of the concept of countertransference, which itself derives from the one-person model. In Ogden&#39;s hands it becomes a dynamic and virtually poetic instrument for capturing the elusive subjective/intersubjective ghosts of the consulting room. His recounting of his reverie during sessions with patients elevates the mundane recordings of his distractions into a highly sensitive psychoanalytic subjectivity that he is able, with consummate effort, to place at the disposal of the analysis. His efforts to do so shine through the work and constitute one of the finest displays of the artistry of analysis that I have ever witnessed. &#34;This book is a work of dedication, of beauty, and of art. It helps us to come to grips with a depth and with a totality of intersubjective intimacy in analytic work that has hitherto been difficult to conceive. One&#39;s work with patients and how one conceptualizes it will be forever changed from the experience of reading these pages. Mine already has&#34;.<b>Thomas H.

In this volume, she explores communications, answering all the vexing questions of what to do, when, and how to do it correctly. 192 pp. Author interviews. National radio publicity. National on-line publicity. National print ads. 50,000 print.</p><p>Miss Manners has no tolerance for call-waiting, but answering machines, E-mail, and fax machines--used with consideration and an understanding of basic etiquette--are fine with her. Miss Manners's Gentle Readers will be encouraged to know that author Martin (Miss Manners Rescues Civilization, p. 581, etc.), while still occasionally employing her favorite quill pen for sensitive communication, also quite capably operates the latest technology to keep in touch with friends, family, and business colleagues. Apparently the first in a series of ``Basic Training'' etiquette manuals, this volume gets right to basic principles in the first chapter, setting readers straight on the stumbling blocks of some communications tools: Do not, for instance, send private messages by fax unless you want them to be read and chortled over by office staff and others the message does not concern. Do not take beepers to church or to events where the noise might disturb the pleasure or concentration of those present. Answering machines and voice-mail are a boon, undermining the tyranny of the telephone. It is not bad manners to let your machine pick up the call; it is bad manners to whip out your cellular phone when you are a guest at a party. In other chapters, Miss Manners hails the ``netiquette'' of Internet users, deplores ``customized'' letters, whether business or personal, and touts the simple, handwritten note as both less time-consuming and less expensive than shopping for an off-the- rack card of sympathy or congratulations. In an easy-to-use chart, icons flag the most appropriate medium for various types of messages. There are also samples of proper correspondence, from basic invitations to political harangues.

But in her vocation, the propagation of politesse, technology allows her no respite from appellants demanding her rulings on misdemeanors in the use of caller ID, call waiting, the Internet, facsimile machines, cellular phones, beepers, and other electronic contraptions. They plead; she adjudicates; we laugh, because there's always humor in the appalling behavior of others--which Martin teases out in her patented arch responses. And whereas she previously saved all humanity, she here sets more modest goals in her promotion of gentility: this book might be sub-subtitled "Boot Camp for Boors." For those who think there is nothing wrong with faxing personal news, with stiffing a caller with call waiting, with leaving cutesy messages on answering machines, Miss Manners renders deserved judgment on their trespasses. Yet her cause is the reformation of recusants, not their immolation at the stake (which would be impolite). Her pronouncements, read as distracting comedy or heeded seriously, are immensely popular, so make way for patron demand. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>Basic Writings of Nietzsche</h2><p><p><b>Introduction by Peter Gay</b><br><b>Translated and edited by Walter Kaufmann </b><br><b>Commentary by Martin Heidegger, Albert Camus, and Gilles Deleuze</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>One hundred years after his death, Friedrich Nietzsche remains the most influential philosopher of the modern era. <i>Basic Writings of Nietzsche</i> gathers the complete texts of five of Nietzsche&#x2019;s most important works, from his first book to his last: <i>The Birth of Tragedy, Beyond Good and Evil, On the Genealogy of Morals, The Case of Wagner, </i>and <i>Ecce Homo</i>.

Bob. Archibald. These Veggie Tales stars are the most famous vegetables you'll ever eat. Oops, meet. Their antics are known around the world. But so much of the Veggie Tale story hasn't been told. In <strong><em>Me, Myself, and Bob</em></strong>, Phil Vischer, founder of Big Idea and creator of Veggie Tales, gives a behind-the-scenes look at his not-so-funny journey with the loveable veggies. From famed creator to bankrupt dreamer, Vischer shares his story of trial and ultimate triumph as God inspired him with one big idea after another.</p><p>When computer-animator <b>Phil Vischer</b> sat down to create delightfully weird characters to teach Christian values to kids, Bob the tomato and a Larry the cucumber were born. VeggieTales revolutionized Christian filmmaking, sold more than 40 million videos and placed faith-filled stories in one of three American households with young children. Phil continues to pursue new ways to integrate faith and storytelling. Phil lives with his wife Lisa, their three kids, and one dog in Illinois.Have you ever been tempted to start your own business? First read this cautionary tale, especially if you think your ideas come from God. Vischer, a pioneer in computerized animation and creator of Veggie Tales, proves that a pathetically skinny, shy techno-geek can be hilarious even when describing his headlong plunge into bankruptcy. In 1989, "with an unflappable 'How hard could it be' attitude," the 22-year-old entrepreneur launched his dream of creating high-quality Christian entertainment by founding the company that would become Big Idea Productions. Thirteen stressful years later, he was featured in a <i>People</i> magazine cover story&#x2014;"small town kid kicked out of Bible college and down to his last ten bucks creates talking vegetables and hits it big, selling 40 million videos!"&#x2014;shortly before firing half his staff in an unsuccessful attempt to avert disaster. While Vischer accepts the blame for the collapse ("my strengths built Big Idea, and my weaknesses brought it down"), he also details various unnamed executives' incompetence. One question haunted him: if he was doing God's work, why didn't God rescue his company? Concluding his story of spiritual inspiration and heartbreak, Vischer draws lessons from his experience for anyone who has ever lost a dream. <i>(Jan. 9)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Strange is the feeling that then presses in upon you--a feeling of enigmatic fear in the presence of this blind dreamlike earth-bound existence. The dumb forest, the silent meadows, this bush, that twig, do not stir themselves, it is the wind that plays with them. Only the little gnat is free--he dances still in the evening light, he moves whither he will. <br> <br>A plant is nothing on its own account. It forms a part of the landscape in which a chance made it take root. The twilight, the chill, the closing of every flower--these are not cause and effect, not danger and willed answer to danger. They are a single process of nature, which is accomplishing itself near, with, and in the plant. The individual is not free to look out for itself, will for itself, or choose for itself. <br> <br>An animal, on the contrary, can choose. It is emancipated from the servitude of all the rest of the world. This midget swarm that dances on and on, that solitary bird still flying through the evening, the fox approaching furtively the nest--these are little worlds of their own within another great world. An animalcule in a drop of water, too tiny to be perceived by the human eye, though it lasts but a second and has but a corner of this drop as its field--nevertheless is free and independent in the face of the universe. The giant oak, upon one of whose leaves the droplet hangs, is not. <br> <br>Servitude and freedom--this is in last and deepest analysis the differentia by which we distinguish vegetable and animal existence. Yet only the plant is wholly and entirely what ti is; in the being of the animal there is something dual. A vegetable is only a vegetable; an animal is a vegetable and something more besides.

He studied mathematics, philosophy, and history at Munich and Berlin. Except for his doctor's thesis on Heraclitus, he published nothing before the first volume of The Decline of the West, which appeared when he was thirty-eight. The Agadir crisis of 1911 provided the immediate incentive for his exhaustive investigations of the background and origins of our civilization. He chose his main title in 1912, finished the first draft of "Form and Actuality" ("Gestalt und Wirklichkeit") two years later, and published the volume in 1918. The second, extensively revised edition, from which the present translation was made, appeared in 1923. The concluding volume, "Perspectives of World-History" ("Welthistorische Perspektiven"), was published in 1922. The Decline of the West was first published in this country in 1906 (Vol. I) and 1928 (Vol. II).<br><br>For many years Spengler lived quietly in his home in Munich. thinking, writing, and pursuing his hobbies - the collecting of pictures and primitive weapons, listening to Beethoven quartets, reading the comedies of Shakespeare and Moliere, and taking occasional trips to the Harz Mountains and to Italy.

The fifty researchers represented five research teams. There was Laura Svetkey, MD, and her team from Duke; George Bray, MD, and his team from the Pennington Center in Louisiana; Larry Appel, MD, and his team from Johns Hopkins; Bill Vollmer, PhD, and his team from Oregon Health Sciences Center; and my team from Harvard. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute had selected these five teams from among forty applicants. Our task was to design an eating pattern that would lower blood pressure.<br> <br>The teams had never worked together before. In fact, most of us did not even know one another. But it became clear from the very beginning that we were willing and eager to work together to design the &#x201c;perfect&#x201d; diet. By the end of that first meeting, we had agreed on a rough outline of the diets we would test and how we would test them. And I was honored that the group had selected me as the chairman of the overall study.<br> <br>But it took another twelve months before we were ready to start testing the first research volunteer. That&#x2019;s how long it took to design a study as complex and tightly controlled as the DASH study. DASH was a &#x201c;feeding study&#x201d;&#x2014;that means we gave the research volunteers all of their food for the entire eleven weeks of the study. Volunteers were going to be studied simultaneously in North Carolina, Maryland, Louisiana, and Massachusetts. To be sure that the study was being conducted in the same way at all four sites and that the subjects at all sites were eating the same foods, we prepared careful menus and recipes that would be served in each location. We even worked with food companies that agreed to ship food items (such as bread, crackers, soup, and fruit) from the same production batch to all of our four sites so that the study volunteers were in fact eating identical foods. Samples of each recipe and meal were prepared, ground up, and chemically analyzed so that we were sure exactly what was in the foods. In addition, researchers at each site received identical training on how to measure blood pressure, how to weigh subjects, and how to measure body fat. We wanted to be absolutely sure that all four sites were feeding subjects the same food and measuring the effects of the diet in an identical way.<br> <br>Once the study was designed, the four sites enrolled 459 volunteers in two and a half years. We tested three different diets. One third of the subjects ate a typical American diet. One third of the subjects ate a typical American diet enriched in fruits and vegetables. And the rest of the subjects received what is now called the DASH Diet. When the results were analyzed, the DASH Diet lowered systolic blood pressure by nearly 11 points&#x2014;about as much as a typical antihypertensive medication and, in fact, far more than we researchers expected.<br> <br>Since we first published these results in 1997 in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine,</i> many other studies have shown additional benefits of the DASH Diet. We know that it lowers blood pressure in people with high blood pressure, but we also now know that the DASH Diet reduces the development of hypertension, heart failure, heart attacks, and kidney stones, and even reduces the risk of developing colon cancer. Studies have shown that people who eat the DASH Diet &#x201c;feel better.&#x201d; One study even showed that the DASH Diet improves the ability to think clearly! And&#x2014;most important for this book&#x2014;the DASH Diet has also proven to be a <i>very effective tool for those who want to lose weight.</i><br> <br>So although DASH started off as a diet to lower blood pressure, with all this additional scientific evidence, the US Department of Agriculture now recommends the DASH Diet as the ideal eating pattern for all Americans. And a recent <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i> ranking rated the DASH Diet as the &#x201c;#1 Best Overall Diet&#x201d; when compared to twenty other popular diets such as Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, and South Beach.<br> <br>But I often hear the comment, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s fine that the DASH Diet shows all those benefits when it&#x2019;s tested in a study where volunteers are being given all of their food by the study staff. But how does the DASH Diet work in real life, when people need to select and prepare their own food?&#x201d;<br> <br>We&#x2019;re happy to say that it works just fine. Dietitians and nutritionists routinely recommend the DASH Diet to people who are interested in improving their eating habits, who have specific medical conditions that would benefit from DASH, and who want to lose weight. People like the DASH Diet because it is easy to understand. It is about real foods, not special supplements or meals that you have to buy from a specific manufacturer. You can shop for the DASH Diet at the same stores where you&#x2019;ve always shopped, and it allows you to follow either a meat-eater or vegetarian diet.<br> <br>The DASH Diet started out as a tightly controlled scientific study but has turned into something much larger. Doctors, nutritionists, government agencies, and organizations such as the American Heart Association are recommending the DASH Diet. Now we want to get the 150 million Americans who would benefit from the DASH Diet to try it and stick with it.<br> <br>We hope this book will be part of that solution.</p><h2>The Complete Guide to Surf Fitness: The Definitive Guide to Surf Training Whatever Your Level</h2><p><p>The Complete Guide To Surf Fitness brings together all the latest knowledge and techniques to offer a complete training program for beginners to pro's.

They had pulled themselves together from the ruin of war, built at breakneck speed a formidable array of export champions, and emerged as the world's number-two economy and largest net creditor nation. And they did it by flouting every rule of economic orthodoxy. But today only the puzzlement remains &#x2014;at Japan's inability to arrest its economic decline, at its festering banking crisis, and at the dithering of its policymakers. Why can't the Japanese government find the political will to fix the country's problems? Japan's Policy Trap offers a provocative new analysis of the country's protracted economic stagnation. Japanese insider Akio Mikuni and long-term Japan resident R. Taggart Murphy contend that the country has landed in a policy trap that defies easy solution. The authors, who have together spent decades at the heart of Japanese finance, expose the deep-rooted political arrangements that have distorted Japan's monetary policy in a deflationary direction. They link Japan's economic difficulties to the Achilles' heel of the U.S. economy: the U.S. trade and current accounts deficits. For the last twenty years, Japan's dollar-denominated trade surplus has outstripped official reserves and currency in circulation. These huge accumulated surpluses have long exercised a growing and perverse influence on monetary policy, forcing Japan's authorities to support a build-up of deflationary dollars. Mikuni and Murphy trace the origins of Japan's policy trap far back into history, in the measures taken by Japan's officials to preserve their economic independence in what they saw as a hostile world. Mobilizing every resource to accumulate precious dollars, the authorities eventually found themselves coping with a hoard they could neither use nor exchange. To counteract the deflationary impact, Japanese authorities resorted to the creation of yen liabilities unrelated to production via the largest financial bubble in history. The bursting of that bubble was followed by massive public works spending that has resulted in an explosion in public sector debt. Japan's Policy Trap points to the likelihood that Japan will run out of ways to support its vast pile of dollar claims. Should the day come when those claims can no longer be supported, the world could see a horrific deflationary spiral in Japan, a crash in the global value of the dollar, or both. The effects would reach far beyond Japan's borders. Mikuni and Murphy suggest that a reduction in Japan's surplus must be accompanied by a reduction in deficits somewhere else &#x2014;most obviously through far-reaching shifts in the American economy.</p></p><p><p><b>Akio Mikuni </b>is one of the most universally respected analysts of the Japanese economy in the global financial community.

February 1, 1866.<br>Nelson Story and his three companions arrived in Fort Worth in the early afternoon.<br>&#x201c;Wal,&#x201d; Coon Tails said, &#x201c;I dunno what else this place has got goin&#x2019; fer it, but they&#x2019;s a blessed plenty of blue bellies.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Texas and all the South is under reconstruction,&#x201d; said Story. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll have to report to the officer in charge and identify ourselves.

Us being strangers in town, we&#x2019;d best find the soldiers before they come looking for us.&#x201d;<br>Before they reached the end of the block, a pair of Union soldiers confronted them. One of them was Negro, and neither seemed more than a year or two out of their teens. They stood in the muddy street, their muzzle loaders at port arms.

Ask for Captain Clark.&#x201d;*<br>Story and his men rode on, and when they turned the corner as directed, Story could see the pair of soldiers following on foot. Having stated his intentions, he found it irritating that he and his men were not trusted to ride to the officer&#x2019;s tent without an armed escort. Reaching the tent, they were eyed suspiciously by a corporal who stood near the closed flap of the tent. He faced them, his rifle at port arms, a question in his eyes.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re from Montana,&#x201d; Story repeated, &#x201c;here to buy Texas cattle. I want to speak to Captain Clark, the post commander.&#x201d;<br>Before the soldier could respond, the tent flap was swept aside, and the officer who emerged could only have been the officer. He was smartly dressed, and from the epaulets of his blue tunic, captain&#x2019;s bars flashed in the afternoon sun.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Captain Clark,&#x201d; said the officer.<br>&#x201c;I reckon you heard what I said,&#x201d; Story replied. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Nelson Story, and these men are part of my outfit. I only want you to be aware of our purpose here. Is there any reason why we can&#x2019;t ride from ranch to ranch, buying the cattle we want?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;None that I know of,&#x201d; said Clark. &#x201c;However, I must remind you that Texas is under federal jurisdiction. If you hire Texas cowboys, they&#x2019;ll need permission to leave the state.&#x201d;<br>Story and his men were still mounted, and Story sidestepped his horse nearer, so that he looked the captain squarely in the eyes when he spoke.<br>&#x201c;Obviously I don&#x2019;t have enough men for a cattle drive, Captain, so I will be hiring riders. Is that going to be a problem, getting permission for them to leave Texas?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Only if they have taken up arms against the United States,&#x201d; said Captain Clark. &#x201c;In that case, it will be left to my discretion. Those who fought for the Confederacy will be required to sign papers, swearing never again to take up arms against the Union.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thank you, Captain,&#x201d; Story said. He rode back the way he had come, with Coon Tails, Allen, and Petty following.<br>&#x201c;Them federals is a hard-nosed bunch,&#x201d; said Petty when they were well away from the officer&#x2019;s tent. &#x201c;The war&#x2019;s done, and they whupped the Rebs. What&#x2019;s to be gained by keepin&#x2019; &#x2019;em penned up like a bunch of mavericks?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Reconstruction is a cruel punishment conceived by a few vindictive men in Washington,&#x201d; Story said, &#x201c;but as long as we&#x2019;re in Texas, the law&#x2019;s what they say it is.&#x201d;<br>Story and his men rode past saloons, cafes, pool parlors, and several hotels. Story seemed to know what he was seeking. They rode south, the town thinning out, until they reached what was obviously a large livery barn. On one side of it was a six-pole-high corral where four horses picked at some hay. On the other side of the barn was a long, low building built of logs and chinked with mud. Above the door, across the front of it, was a sign that read: YORK AND DRAPER. Drover&#x2019;s Supplies, Livestock, Wagons.<br>&#x201c;We need information,&#x201d; said Story. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll start here.&#x201d;<br>They dismounted, Story leading the way into the dim interior of the building. A long counter ran from wall to wall, with a swinging door at each end. On a stool behind the counter sat a bald man wearing an eyeshade, working over a ledger by the light of a lamp. He looked up as they entered, and Story spoke.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Nelson Story. We&#x2019;re from Montana, here to buy cattle. I&#x2019;ll be needin&#x2019; riders as well as cows.&#x201d;<br>It was an unasked question, put in a manner that invited a response, rather than demanding one.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m York,&#x201d; said the man at the counter, &#x201c;and I can&#x2019;t be of much help to you in findin&#x2019; cows. Just about everybody that can raise a herd and afford an outfit ain&#x2019;t sellin&#x2019; locally. Had a dozen drives go up the trail last fall, and there must be fifty more plannin&#x2019; to move out in a month or so. I ain&#x2019;t sayin&#x2019; you can&#x2019;t buy cows. You can, but they&#x2019;ll cost you ten dollars a head, and there won&#x2019;t be many two-year-old steers. As for riders, I can&#x2019;t say. Might pick up a few that&#x2019;s sold their cows or can&#x2019;t afford a trail drive. Try the saloons and pool halls.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; Story said, and not until they reached their horses did he speak to his companions. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll find us a hotel, get some grub under our belts, and look around some.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;This hombre York didn&#x2019;t seem too anxious to help us,&#x201d; said Tom Allen.<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s partial to Texans,&#x201d; Story said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll have to expect that. It&#x2019;s hard times here, and a man selling his cows for ten dollars a head makes no sense, if there&#x2019;s a chance he can do better.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Wal, hell,&#x201d; said Coon Tails, &#x201c;ever&#x2019;body in Texas ain&#x2019;t got enough cows fer a drive, an&#x2019; if&#x2019;n they did, they wouldn&#x2019;t have the cash fer their outfits. After supper, when the saloons an&#x2019; billiard parlors commence t&#x2019;fill up, why don&#x2019;t we split up, circulate, an&#x2019; listen?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I think we&#x2019;ll do exactly that,&#x201d; Story said. &#x201c;When a man&#x2019;s needin&#x2019; cash, ten dollars a head now is worth fifty at the end of a trail he can&#x2019;t afford to ride.&#x201d;<br>They reined up before the Fort Worth House, a two-story hotel constructed of lumber, and it bore evidence of once having been painted. A porch ran all the way across the front of the building, and above that a balcony, with a single roof covering both. On the lower porch a bench ran the length of the wall from either side of the double front doors. Half a dozen men sat there watching the newcomers approach. Several of the locals were chewing plug, spitting over the porch railing. Numerous stains attested to their inaccuracy. Story and his men nodded to the observers, entered the hotel, and Story took a pair of rooms.<br>&#x201c;I ain&#x2019;t one fer beds,&#x201d; said Coon Tails. &#x201c;Jist gimme room t&#x2019;spread my blankets on the floor.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You can have my floor, then,&#x201d; Story said. &#x201c;I reckon Bill and Tom are used to one another&#x2019;s snoring.&#x201d;<br>They climbed the stairs. The rooms were nothing fancy, but they seemed clean. There was a chair, a four-drawer dresser, and attached to the wall above it, a small mirror. On the dresser there was a washbasin and a porcelain pitcher. An iron bed stood next to the only window, and the fire escape consisted of a length of rope, one end of which was tied to a leg of the bed. Story and Coon Tails took the first room, which was on their left, while Bill Petty and Tom Allen took the second room, across the hall. Story removed his boots and hat, stretching out on the bed. Coon Tails spread his blankets.<br>&#x201c;Should of brung my saddle, &#x2019;stead o&#x2019; leavin&#x2019; it at the livery,&#x201d; the old mountain man said. &#x201c;Makes a dang good piller.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s two pillows on the bed,&#x201d; said Story. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome to one of them.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thankee,&#x201d; said Coon Tails, &#x201c;but they&#x2019;s too soft. I&#x2019;ll make do.&#x201d;<br>Nelson Story wasn&#x2019;t a man to lie abed in the afternoon. In less than an hour he was up, sitting on the edge of the bed, looking out the window. Coon Tails got up, rolling his blankets, reaching for his battered old hat.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a mite early t&#x2019;hit the saloons,&#x201d; Coon Tails said, &#x201c;but I purely got t&#x2019;do somethin&#x2019;. These fancy hotels is passable fer sleepin&#x2019;, I reckon, but I can&#x2019;t see much need fer &#x2019;em in the daytime, less&#x2019;n a man be crippled.&#x201d;<br>Story laughed. &#x201c;I was thinking the same thing,&#x201d; he said, reaching for his boots. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s roust Bill and Tom and go find us some steaks with plenty of potatoes, onions, and hot coffee.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;A mite early fer supper,&#x201d; said Coon Tails, &#x201c;but I kin always eat ag&#x2019;in.&#x201d;<br>Petty and Allen were eager and ready to leave the hotel, and the four of them headed for a cafe they had passed earlier. The place had no name. The entire front of the slab-sided building had been decorated with a black-painted likeness of a longhorn bull. Beneath that, in ragged red letters, was a single word: GRUB.<br>&#x201c;With a front like this,&#x201d; Bill Petty said, &#x201c;if they ain&#x2019;t got steak, we oughta pull our irons and shoot up the place.&#x201d;<br>Since it was well past the dinner hour and much too early f...</p></p><h2>Signs for Lost Children</h2><p><b>Shortlisted for the Wellcome Prize for Historical Fiction</b><br><br>Award-winning author Sarah Moss's most recent work of historical fiction is a portrait of a young couple's unconventional marriage as it's tested by separate quests for identity in work and life. Set in the Victorian Age, <i>Signs for Lost Children</i> grapples with central themes of early feminism, mental health reform, and marriage as an imposed institution.&nbsp;<br><br>Ally Moberly, a recently qualified doctor, never expected to marry until she met Tom Cavendish. Only weeks into their marriage, Tom sets out for Japan, leaving Ally as she begins work at the Truro Asylum in Cornwall. Horrified by the brutal attitudes of male doctors and nurses toward their female patients, Ally plunges into the institutional politics of women's mental health at a time when madness is only just being imagined as treatable. She has to contend with a longstanding tradition of permanently institutionalizing women who are deemed difficult, all the while fighting to to be taken seriously as a rare woman in a profession dominated by men. Tom, an architect, has been employed to oversee the building of Japanese lighthouses. He also has a commission from a wealthy collector to bring back embroideries and woodwork. As he travels Japan in search of these enchanting objects, he begins to question the value of the life he left in England. As Ally becomes increasingly absorbed in the moral importance of her work, and Tom pursues his intellectual interests on the other side of the world, they will return to each other as different people.<br><br>With her artful blend of emotional insight and narrative skill, Sarah Moss creates an entrancing novel sure to draw critical acclaim.

However, as Stephen Marglin argues, market relationships erode community. In the past, for example, when a farm family experienced a setback--say the barn burned down--neighbors pitched in. Now a farmer whose barn burns down turns, not to his neighbors, but to his insurance company. Insurance may be a more efficient way to organize resources than a community barn raising, but the deep social and human ties that are constitutive of community are weakened by the shift from reciprocity to market relations. </p><p> Marglin dissects the ways in which the foundational assumptions of economics justify a world in which individuals are isolated from one another and social connections are impoverished as people define themselves in terms of how much they can afford to consume. Over the last four centuries, this economic ideology has become the dominant ideology in much of the world. Marglin presents an account of how this happened and an argument for righting the imbalance in our lives that this ideology has fostered. </p></p><p>Stephen A. Marglin is Walter Barker Professor of Economics at Harvard University.Stephen Marglin's <i>The Dismal Science</i> is a beautifully written and powerfully argued book that shows how the ideology of economics has justified and supported the trend towards selfishness and hyper-individualism in advanced societies.<br> --Bianca Jagger<br><br>In this timely and eloquent critique of the conventional economist's "ideology of knowledge," Stephen Marglin pinpoints a huge blind spot at the heart of this powerful discipline. They can't see community. It's not that the people of the earth are, for the economist, bereft of community. It's that he imagines them as interest-maximizing tin men who don't need it. So as Wal-Mart mows down local communities in America and NAFTA mows them down in rural Mexico, the conventional economist stands silent on this issue. Economists and non-economists alike should read this book, and pass it around to friends in their community--if it's still there.<br> --Arlie Russell Hochschild, University of California, Berkeley and author of <i>The Time Bind</i> and <i>The Commercialization of Intimate Life</i><br><br>A brilliantly reasoned and long overdue expose of the intellectual and moral bankruptcy of conventional economic thinking. If you are concerned about the decline of community and moral standards in public life, read this book.<br> --David C. Korten, author of <i>The Great Turning: From Empire to Earth Community</i> and <i>When Corporations Rule the World</i><br><br>With breathtaking range, Stephen Marglin brilliantly turns the world of economics upside-down as he reveals the roots of economics in the Western myth of modernity and the destruction of community. At once analytical and intuitive, Marglin unites the talents of an economist, a storyteller's humor and a skeptical mind to offer a new way of thinking about economy and economics. <br> --Stephen Gudeman, University of Minnesota<br><br><i>The Dismal Science</i> is a profound critique of economics by one of its own. It could not be more timely--the breakdown of human connection is arguably the most serious problem facing humanity, as it underlies other ills such as violence, environmental degradation and inequality. Stephen Marglin has produced a beautifully written and penetratingly intelligent argument about the role of the market in that process.<br> --Juliet Schor, Boston College and author of <i>The Overspent American: Why We Want What We Don't Need</i><br><br>Stephen Marglin makes a powerful and convincing argument for how thinking like an economist undermines community. Suddenly, the choices of those who reject global capitalism seem far more reasonable, because the globalization of capital brings with it the economistic thinking that destroys local values, forcing us to choose between material prosperity and spiritual health. Yet this tension is made invisible by a pseudo-universal ideology about human nature. Marglin thus provides a persuasive foundation for the Politics of Meaning. (<i>Tikkun</i> 2008-03-01)<br><br>Marglin's demonstration of the relationship between mainstream economics and the destruction of communities is seductive, convincing, and well documented.<br> --Danny Lang (<i>Irish Times</i> 2008-03-24)<br><br>This is an exceptionally learned, uncompromisingly contrarian critique of markets and economics by a member of the Department of Economics at Harvard University. Stephen Marglin emphasizes the costs of market transactions and blames economics for supplying the associated frame of reference. <i>The Dismal Science</i> is patently the result of a lifetime of reading and cogitating about conceptual issues related to market exchanges and economists&#x2019; approaches to them. Some historical background is given but what is mainly offered is extended commentary on the history of thought and on everyday practice.<br> --Eric Jones (<i>EH.NET</i>)</p><h2>The Best of Pogo: An Exuberant Collection of Walt Kelly&#39;s Immortal Cartoons Plus Photos, Articles and Other Pogo Memorabilia from the Pages of The Okefenokee Star</h2><p>Rear cover notes: &#34;For Pogo fans everywhere, young and old, here&#39;s the best and brightest of the comic strip superstar and his creator, Walt Kelly, all in one volume.

The body of Edgar Allan Poe has been buried in an unmarked grave. The public, the press, and even Poe&#x2019;s own family and friends accept the conclusion that Poe was a second-rate writer who met a disgraceful end as a drunkard.

Yet the two are drawn powerfully together even when it is clear they are bound to bring each other grief. Their difficult marriage leads them and their children to a house made of glass in theConnecticut&nbsp;countryside, to the avenues of&nbsp;Manhattan, and to the blue waters of Long Island Sound.

She lives outside Boston.Mare Winningham's reading is level, her delivery almost factual, providing strong roots that ground us when Hoffman leaps into moments of magical realism in telling the story of Arlyn Singer. On the day of her father's funeral, 17-year-old Arlyn waits for her true love to show up. Enter the distant John Moody, an unlikely candidate. Winningham's even tones seem to record the characters' resignation--their adjustment to a bad marriage, Arlyn's conclusion of a love affair, and her acceptance of her own death.

Philosophical thought is deciphered and made comprehensive and interesting to almost everyone. Far from being a novelty, each book is a highly refined appraisal of the philosopher and his work, authoritative and clearly presented.</p><p>David Hume (1711-1776), writes Paul Strathern, is &#34;the only philosopher whose ideas remain plausible to us today.&#34; Hume&#39;s most substantial contribution to philosophy could be simplified as the denial of the existence of anything but our own perceptions--or it could be more subtly described as a realization of the contingency of our knowledge of the world, where any explanation for phenomena--be it rooted in religion, science, or some other discipline--is uncertain. Strathern&#39;s short volume puts Hume&#39;s &#34;extreme empiricism&#34; and the rest of his career into perspective with the author&#39;s usual dry wit--as when he summarizes Hume&#39;s positions on miracles and suicide as &#34;no such thing&#34; and &#34;up to you.&#34;Paul Strathern is author of the popular and critically acclaimed Philosophers in 90 Minutes series. Highlights from the series include <i>Nietzsche in 90 Minutes, Aristotle in 90 Minutes</i>, and <i>Plato in 90 Minutes</i>. Mr. Strathern has lectured in philosophy and mathematics and now lives and writes in London. A former Somerset Maugham prize winner, he is also the author of books on history and travel as well as five novels.

A scientist, a philosopher, and a poet, Donald Culross Peattie takes us on an confessional journey across the landscape of his life. Told in flashbacks of years past and interspersed with impressions of a journey by motorcar across the American West, it is intensely personal. It is American in the best sense of the word. From saying goodbye to the trees at his childhood home on Lake Michigan to a man formed via Harvard and New York City, finally discovering a belief in the nature of things in a cabin in the Grand Tentons, it is not told as as linear life story but rather an adventure in living, in science, in thought.</p><p><b>Donald Culross Peattie</b> (1898&#x2013;1964) was one of the most influential American nature writers of the 20th century. Peattie was born in Chicago and grew up in Smoky Mountains in North Carolina, which sparked his interest in the immense wonders of nature. He studied at the University of Chicago and Harvard University. After working for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, he decided to pursue a career as a writer. In 1925 he became a nature columnist for the <i>Washington Star Newspaper</i> and subsequently went on to pen more than twenty fiction and nonfiction books in the next five decades. Widely acclaimed and popular in his age, his legacy has been attributed as inspiring a modern age of nature writing.<br></p><h2>The Wives of Los Alamos: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>Finalist for the PEN/Robert W.

Though I read about the lead scientists, even more interesting to me was to think of what life was like for their educated, newly married wives who followed their husbands to an unknown location in New Mexico. I wanted to know these women and be their friend and make more space in the world for their voices. </p> <p><b>2.</b> What do you enjoy reading and writing about historical fiction? </p> <p><b>TSN</b>: In historical fiction, time has stopped, at least for a little while, and I get to see, in slow motion, how co-existing experiences and points of view interact with and affect one another. Another thrill is how much historical fiction actually reveals about the time period in which it is written&#x2014;the preoccupations and focuses of revisionist history, for example, shift as our contemporary moment shifts.

Even months after American blood had been shed at Lexington and Concord, many colonists remained loyal to Britain. John Adams, a leader of the revolutionary effort, said bringing the fractious colonies together was like getting "thirteen clocks to strike at once." </p><br><br><p> Other books have been written about the Declaration, but no author has traced the political journey from protest to Revolution with the narrative scope and flair of John Ferling. <i>Independence</i> takes readers from the cobblestones of Philadelphia into the halls of Parliament, where many sympathized with the Americans and furious debate erupted over how to deal with the rebellion.<i> Independence</i> is not only the story of how freedom was won, but how an empire was lost. </p><br><br><p> At this remarkable moment in history, high-stakes politics was intertwined with a profound debate about democracy, governance, and justice. John Ferling, drawing on a lifetime of scholarship, brings this passionate struggle to life as no other historian could. <i>Independence</i> will be hailed as the finest work yet from the author Michael Beschloss calls "a national resource."</p></p><p><b>John Ferling</b> is professor emeritus of history at the State University of West Georgia. A leading authority on American Revolutionary history, he has appeared in many documentaries and has written numerous books, including <i>The Ascent of George Washington: The Hidden Political Genius of an American Icon</i>, <i>Almost a Miracle: The American Victory in the War of Independence</i>, <i>Setting the World Ablaze: Washington, Adams, Jefferson, and the American Revolution</i>, and the award-winning <i>A Leap in the Dark: The Struggle to Create the American Republic</i>.<p>&#x201c;Mesmerizing. Masterful. History written with the gravitational pull of a good novel. A history book that deserves to become a big best seller.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Dan Rather</i></p><p>&#x201c;This is how it really happened. In unequivocal prose, John Ferling captures the combined bluster and outrage on both sides of the Atlantic. He exposes the quirks, while exploring the vision, of the opinionated, opportunistic delegates who were present in Philadelphia in 1776; he shows us just how they rhetorically overcame the "mystique of invincibility" that attached to the British military, before launching America, in the words of one delegate, "on a most Tempestuous Sea." <i>Independence</i> is rich in personality, and Ferling unsurpassed as an authority. This is no ordinary history.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Andrew Burstein, author of Jefferson's Secrets, and coauthor of Madison and Jefferson</i></p><p>&#x201c;John Ferling has established himself as one of the leading chroniclers of the American Revolution, but <i>Independence</i> goes beyond anything he has written before. Instead of recycling the familiar story of the Revolution, he has given us an enlightening and exciting book that proves that history has no guarantees or foreordained outcomes. Expertly blending biographical vignettes with fast-paced narrative and sure-footed interpretation, Ferling captures the mystery of historical contingency in exploring the period between the Boston Tea Party in 1773 and the declaration of American independence in 1776. Not even the founding fathers knew what the future would bring; Ferling performs a national public service in reminding us of this basic fact, and demonstrating it with elegance and style.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>R. B. Bernstein, distinguished adjunct professor of law, New York Law School, and author of The Founding Fathers Reconsidered and Thomas Jefferson</i></p><p>&#x201c;In clear and elegant prose and with formidable scholarship, John Ferling freshly examines the period that led to declaring independence. By focusing on the character of leaders in both England and her colonies as they intersected with circumstances, he captures the uncertainty of the times and the unpredictable journey to the declaration itself.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Edith B. Gelles, author of Abigail and John: Portrait of a Marriage</i></p><p>&#x201c;A venerable historian of the American Revolution focuses on the events between the shot heard round the world and the signing of the Declaration of Independence ...

Terman, developer of the Stanford-Binet test for intelligence, believed that geniuses were born, not made. He also believed that bright people were not maladjusted nerds but were capable of productive, happy lives. To prove his theories, he designed a study that would identify children with unusually high IQs and track them to the end of their lives. Many of the ``Termites,'' as they were dubbed, are still alive and are still being studied by Terman's academic heirs. Shurkin, a teacher of journalism at Stanford--where Terman was based--was given free access to the files, and he interviewed many of the subjects. A mix of biography, case history, and academic review, his book is also an amazing expos&#x201a; of major flaws in this long-heralded sociological investigation. Shurkin points out, for instance, that there was no control group. Moreover, he says, over the years, Terman constantly meddled in the lives of his subjects, urging them to further education, wrangling scholarships, influencing admissions to college, and exchanging soul-searching letters with many of them. Despite these flaws, though, the sheer mass of material collected by Terman and his followers has made the study of immense value to later researchers. The study's results have in fact undermined the idea that intelligence is all in the genes--family influence has had a strong impact on Termites' achievements. The results, though, have upheld Terman's belief that intelligence contributes to a rewarding life- -rewarding, but with no creative breakthroughs. Shurkin's last sentence is telling: ``The Terman kid who may have had the greatest impact on our society was a comedy writer''--Jess Oppenheimer, the originator of I Love Lucy. Shurkin successfully humanizes the Terman study at the same time that he lifts the veil of romance from its subjects. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Terman (1888-1956), the famed psychologist who developed the Stanford-Binet IQ test, believed that "the right education of . . . superior children" in large part would determine the future welfare of our country. In 1922 he constructed the prototype of longitudinal psychological studies when he and his associates began the study of 1500 California children whose IQs were 135 or higher. With periodic follow-ups that remain active, the "Termites," as they were dubbed, provided an enormous database that may not have disclosed the nature of genius but did prove one of Terman's points--gifted children become gifted adults. The research of academic Shurkin, given access to the guarded files on certain conditions of confidentiality, reveals some of the human stories of the Termites, less than half of whom are still alive. Not all felt blessed by the patronage of Terman, who is shown as paternalistic to a fault and wrong-headed regarding feminine and sexual traits and other important characteristics in his experimental group. Shurkin, who teaches journalism as Stanford and is the author of Intensive Care and other books, personalizes a landmark study. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>An Island Christmas: A Novel</h2><p><b>In this enchanting holiday novel from <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Nancy Thayer, family and friends gather on Nantucket for a gorgeous winter wedding with plenty of merry surprises in store.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> As Christmas draws near, Felicia returns to her family&#x2019;s home on the island to marry her adventurous, rugged boyfriend, Archie.

As twilight fell at four o&#x2019;clock, friends, neighbors, and visiting relatives chatted together, rubbing their hands for warmth and discussing Christmas plans. Children jumped up and down, all antsy with anticipation. Dogs strained at their leashes, trying to sniff other dogs.<br><br>On the top step of the Pacific National Bank, a man dressed like an old-ï¿½time town crier stood in his black cape, red muffler, and glossy top hat, like a conjurer about to perform magic. And wasn&#x2019;t electricity a kind of magic, especially when carried in a cable along the watery floor of Nantucket Sound, thirty miles from the mainland to the island? The town crier offered a hearty greeting, flicked a switch, and suddenly all the way to the harbor, on both sides of the long cobblestone street, short plump festive evergreens burst into twinkling radiance like a chorus line of flamboyant elves. In front of the bank, a thirty-ï¿½foot-ï¿½tall fat Norwegian spruce suddenly blazed with white lights and crimson bows. The holidays had officially arrived, the shops were adorned, and the boisterous crowd, led by the town&#x2019;s beloved music teacher, sang the season&#x2019;s first carols.<br><br>The exuberant voices of the singers carried a few blocks down to a charming, painstakingly restored 1840s Greek Revival house on Chestnut Street. Jilly Gordon, who in past years had always attended the festivities, now sat in her peach cashmere sweater set, curled up on a down-ï¿½filled sofa in front of a crackling fire. She was sobbing.<br><br>Jilly was on the phone with her best friend, Nicole Somerset. &#x201c;Oh, Nicole, I really don&#x2019;t know if my heart can take this.

When she&#x2019;s here, she&#x2019;s always swimming or walking on the moors or out in the harbor sailing or in her kayak or on that&#x2014;ï¿½that, that new way to drown yourself, what do you call it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Paddleboard. It&#x2019;s fun, Jilly.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; Jilly sniffed. &#x201c;Paddleboard. For the elegant woman.&#x201d;<br><br>Nicole laughed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re just all wound up because she&#x2019;s getting married. Come on, Jilly, give the girl some credit for trying to make you happy. She&#x2019;s agreed&#x2014;ï¿½no, she suggested holding her wedding on Nantucket on Christmas Day. Isn&#x2019;t that proof enough she wants to please you?&#x201d;<br><br>Jilly blew her nose on a tissue. She could do this on the telephone with Nicole because they were best friends. &#x201c;I know you&#x2019;re right, Nicole. The irony is, I don&#x2019;t want her to get married here this Christmas. Steven Hardy has just bought the house next door to us right here on Chestnut Street.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wait. Whiplash. What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Miles and Elaine Hardy were our first close friends when we moved here to Nantucket. Their son Steven is just Felicia&#x2019;s age, and they were best friends and maybe more than that. He&#x2019;s knockout handsome and really sweet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve told me about him. Wasn&#x2019;t he Felicia&#x2019;s prom date in high school?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, they made the most stunning couple. They lost touch when they went off to college, and then Miles and Elaine moved to Arizona so we lost touch with them. Now I&#x2019;ve just found out that Steven is moving back here. He&#x2019;s a fabulously successful stockbroker, and he&#x2019;s bought the house next door because he wants to live year-ï¿½round on the island! Just think, Nicole, if Felicia married him&#x2014;ï¿½&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hang on. How do you know he isn&#x2019;t married?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The realtor told me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m speechless.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m desperate! Remember when George and I flew out to see Felicia in Utah last year, we met Archie. He was muddy, bruised, unshaven, and he had blood on his T-ï¿½shirt!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jilly. Get a grip. You told me he&#x2019;d just returned from leading a white-ï¿½water rafting tour. You showed me photos of him. I think Archie&#x2019;s handsome.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fine, he&#x2019;s handsome, but in a Gerard Butler, hairy swashbuckler way. Steven is much more elegant, all very Pierce Brosnan, suit and tie and briefcase. He&#x2019;s been over for dinner since he moved back to the island. I&#x2019;d like to invite him for Christmas dinner.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe you should rethink that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I didn&#x2019;t know Felicia was going to call me up and drop this wedding on me. I thought she&#x2019;d come home for Christmas . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Jilly stopped talking as her mind, leaping ahead of her mouth, exploded with such a brilliant idea she almost laughed aloud. Felicia was bringing Archie to the island two weeks before Christmas, so she&#x2019;d have some time to show her fiancï¿½ all her favorite spots. Two weeks might be just enough time for Jilly to throw Felicia and Steven together . . . surely once they saw each other again, and spent time with each other, and . . .<br><br>&#x201c;Jilly? Are you still there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Um. Sorry. My mind wandered. I guess I&#x2019;m overwhelmed with Felicia&#x2019;s news, plus the responsibility of turning this house into a magic Christmas scene plus a house for a perfect wedding reception.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jilly, you&#x2019;ve got to slow down. You always set your standards way too high. You&#x2019;ll drive yourself crazy this way. Your house doesn&#x2019;t have to look perfect, although I&#x2019;ve got to say you are starting with perfection. I&#x2019;ve never seen a house so beautifully decorated and completely uncluttered as your house. And you know I&#x2019;ll help you in any way I can.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s kind of you, Nicole. I&#x2019;m sure I&#x2019;ll call on you.&#x201d; Jilly took a deep breath. She really wasn&#x2019;t manic or an overwrought anal-ï¿½compulsive. Or maybe she was, but just occasionally. &#x201c;Are your stepdaughter and her family coming to your house this Christmas?&#x201d; Jilly asked.<br><br>&#x201c;No. They&#x2019;re going to spend part of the holiday with her mother and Alonzo and the rest of it with James&#x2019;s parents. I have to say I&#x2019;m relieved. Sebastian and I are looking forward to having a peaceful holiday. We deserve it after last year. Plus, everyone&#x2019;s here for Thanksgiving.&#x201d; Nicole switched the focus back to Jilly. &#x201c;What does George think about all this?&#x201d; George Gordon was a retired accountant: kind, thoughtful, leisurely, and logical.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, George! He stays in his study at his computer working on his family tree.&#x201d; Jilly&#x2019;s laugh was tinged with hysteria. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s kind of ironic, isn&#x2019;t it? He&#x2019;s so busy tracing his ancestors that he doesn&#x2019;t deal with what&#x2019;s going on with his real living family.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, after all, Jilly, what could George do? Do you expect him to fly out to Utah, tie your daughter up, and drive her back here in the trunk of a car?&#x201d; Nicole was glad to attempt to jolly her friend along. Last Christmas, Jilly had saved Nicole from losing her mind. This was what friends did for each other.<br><br>Jilly laughed. &#x201c;Now that you mention it, it doesn&#x2019;t seem like such a bad idea. I think this Archie fellow has Felicia under his spell.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I should certainly hope he has her under his spell if she&#x2019;s going to marry him. That&#x2019;s the only reason to get married, isn&#x2019;t it? Being crazy in love with a man?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nicole, you are such a romantic.&#x201d; Jilly rose from the sofa, picked up a poker, and poked the logs.<br><br>Actually, she realized, it was rather romantic right here in her own living room. The fire filled the house with the friendly crackles and pops and the alluring aroma of apple wood. Her furniture&#x2014;ï¿½handsomely restored antiques or reproductions&#x2014;ï¿½gleamed from frequent polishings, and needlepoint pillows she&#x2019;d created herself brightened the sofas and chairs. The Christmas tree, resplendent with carefully collected antique ornaments, glittered in front of the bay window. All along the fireplace mantel paraded china Christmas figurines she&#x2019;d collected since she was a child: Santa, his sleigh, reindeer, angels, Frosty the Snowman, Snoopy on a plane with his muffler, swans with holly collars. Beneath the mantel hung the elaborate felt stockings she&#x2019;d made for herself, George, and their two daughters, now with Porter&#x2019;s, Lauren&#x2019;s husband, and their two children&#x2019;s stockings added.<br><br>&#x201c;I know you&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; Jilly conceded. &#x201c;I was certainly crazy about George when we got married. But I&#x2019;m not so sure that&#x2019;s the only reason or the main reason to get married. Lauren went into her marriage with a clear head and look how well it&#x2019;s worked out for her. I don&#x2019;t think she would have married Porter if he weren&#x2019;t well-ï¿½mannered, working for a bank, and living in Boston. Lauren knew she would never be far from Nantucket.&#x201d;<br><br>Nicole paused thoughtfully. &#x201c;I have only one stepdaughter Jilly, so maybe I shouldn&#x2019;t have an opinion, and Lauren certainly seems happy enough. But it does seem to me that your daughters are very different people. I think you need to respect that. Felicia isn&#x2019;t going to marry a banker and live in Boston like her older sister did.&#x201d;<br><br>Jilly nodded, even though Nicole couldn&#x2019;t see her. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right, Nicole. I should be grateful I have one daughter who lives nearby and calls me almost every day for a chat.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Plus, you lucky duck, she&#x2019;s given you two adorable grandchildren.&#x201d;<br><br>Jilly paused. After a moment, she confessed, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right again. But you know what, Nicole? Secretly, I&#x2019;m the worst grandmother in the world.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What are you talking about?&#x201d; Nicole asked, surprised.<br><br>Jilly was practically whispering, as if Lauren were standing outside the door. &#x201c;I adore Lawrence and Portia. When I visit them in Boston, we have a great time. But even though they&#x2019;re six and four, they&#x2019;re like wild beasts.&#x201d;<br><br>Nicole chuckled. &#x201c;Calves in the china cupboard?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In this house, yes. Well, some of our furniture belonged to my grandmother. Imagine how old those pieces are! Some of the other pieces George and I paid a pretty penny for at auctions. When we were younger it was our dream to have an elegant home. George&#x2019;s grandparents left him so many precious objects&#x2014;ï¿½porcelain bowls, Tiffany lamps, Limoges vases, figurines. We had to keep them all in storage. We couldn&#x2019;t put them out when our children lived with us, and it&#x2019;s been utterly rejuvenating to restore and decorate this house together. It&#x2019;s made us closer than we were when we were raising the children.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not a bad grandmother because you want to have nice things,&#x201d; Nicole assured Jilly. &#x201c;At our age, we deserve to have our home look the way we want it to look. You raised two children and had your house filled with everything from high chairs to hockey sticks. You have every right to make your house look as perfect as it does. It gives you great pleasure.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aha!&#x201d; Jilly laughed. &#x201c;I know what you&#x2019;re doing. You&#x2019;re trying to use psychology on me. You&#x2019;re trying to make me accept that I have to let Felicia live her own life the way she wants to.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not what I said, but it&#x2019;s true, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I guess you&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; Jilly conceded. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s difficult, Nicole, to feel so much closer to one daughter than the other. It makes me feel guilty. But Lauren has always been just like me. She used to follow me around everywhere, pretending to help me cook and changing her baby dolls the way she saw me change Felicia. Felicia preferred riding her bike or climbing trees. I fought more with Felicia, too, especially when she was in high school. Those ripped jeans? I had to clench my jaw to keep from screaming. I&#x2019;m lucky I have any teeth left.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, you do have all your teeth, and love is wide and deep, and Felicia is not only coming for Christmas, she wants to be married on the island. I&#x2019;d say you did a pretty good job with both your girls.&#x201d; In the background clinking noises sounded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to go. Cookies to bake, packages to wrap.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Me, too. I think my project for today will be to go around the house and remove all the breakable objects, and even some of the more fragile antique furniture.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t forget the bedrooms,&#x201d; Nicole advised.<br><br>&#x201c;As if I could!&#x201d; Last Christmas, five-ï¿½year-ï¿½old Lawrence had somehow managed to crack the spindles on an 1850 Windsor fruitwood armchair in his bedroom. &#x201c;Maybe I&#x2019;ll buy some of those plastic outdoor chairs and put them around,&#x201d; she suggested with a chortle. &#x201c;Nicole, thanks for the talk. You&#x2019;re the best.&#x201d;<br><br>Jilly hung up the phone and rubbed her hands together. She had some serious plotting to do.</p><h2>Seduction: Sex, Lies, and Stardom in Howard Hughes&#39;s Hollywood</h2><p><p>In this riveting popular history, the creator of <em>You Must Remember This</em> probes the inner workings of Hollywood&#x2019;s glamorous golden age through the stories of some of the dozens of actresses pursued by Howard Hughes, to reveal how the millionaire mogul&#x2019;s obsessions with sex, power and publicity trapped, abused, or benefitted women who dreamt of screen stardom.</p><p>In recent months, the media has reported on scores of entertainment figures who used their power and money in Hollywood to sexually harass and coerce some of the most talented women in cinema and television. But as Karina Longworth reminds us, long before the Harvey Weinsteins there was Howard Hughes&#x2014;the Texas millionaire, pilot, and filmmaker whose reputation as a cinematic provocateur was matched only by that as a prolific womanizer.</p><p>His supposed conquests between his first divorce in the late 1920s and his marriage to actress Jean Peters in 1957 included many of Hollywood&#x2019;s most famous actresses, among them Billie Dove, Katharine Hepburn, Ava Gardner, and Lana Turner. From promoting bombshells like Jean Harlow and Jane Russell to his contentious battles with the censors, Hughes&#x2014;perhaps more than any other filmmaker of his era&#x2014;commoditized male desire as he objectified and sexualized women. Yet there were also numerous women pulled into Hughes&#x2019;s grasp who never made it to the screen, sometimes virtually imprisoned by an increasingly paranoid and disturbed Hughes, who retained multitudes of private investigators, security personnel, and informers to make certain these actresses would not escape his clutches.</p><p>Vivid, perceptive, timely, and ridiculously entertaining, <em>The Seducer</em> is a landmark work that examines women, sex, and male power in Hollywood during its golden age&#x2014;a legacy that endures nearly a century later.</p></p><p><p><strong>A wildly entertaining look at Hollywood&#x2019;s glamorous golden age via the cinematic life of Howard Hughes and the actresses who encountered him&#x2014;and suffered the consequences</strong></p><p>Howard Hughes&#x2019;s reputation as a director and producer of films unusually defined by sex dovetails with his image as one of the most prolific womanizers of the twentieth century. The promoter of bomb-shell actresses such as Jean Harlow and Jane Russell, Hughes supposedly included among his off-screen conquests many of the most famous actresses of the era such as Billie Dove, Katharine Hepburn, Ava Gardner, Ginger Rogers, and Lana Turner. His marketing of male desire helped produce an incredibly influential, sexualized image of womanhood that has impacted culture ever since. But there was a price&#x202f;.&#x202f;.&#x202f;.<strong></strong></p><p>In <em>Seduction</em>, Karina Longworth draws upon an unprecedented trove of archival sources, diaries, and documents to produce a land-mark work of Hollywood history that is as effervescent as it is relevant. Seduction is not only about the murkier shades of golden-age Hollywood, but the ripples that still slither across today&#x2019;s entertainment industry and our culture in general.</p><p>Karina Longworth is the creator, writer, and host of <em>You Must Remember This</em>, a podcast on the secret and forgotten history of twentieth-century Hollywood.

In this enthralling new book, Rendell, "the best mystery writer in the English-speaking world" (<i>Time</i>), takes Inspector Wexford back to his days as a young policeman, and to the man he has long suspected of murder -- serial murder.<p>Outside the house where Wexford investigated his first murder case -- a woman found strangled in her bedroom -- he noticed a short, muscular man wearing a scarf and walking a dog. He gave Wexford an unnerving stare. Without any solid evidence, Wexford began to suspect that this man -- Eric Targo, he learned -- was the killer.</p><p>Over the years there are more unsolved, apparently motiveless murders in the town of Kingsmarkham, and Wexford continues to quietly suspect that the increasingly prosperous Targo -- van driver, property developer, kennel owner, and animal lover -- is behind them.</p><p>Now, half a lifetime later, Wexford spots Targo back in Kingsmarkham after a long absence. Wexford tells his longtime partner, Mike Burden, about his suspicions, but Burden dismisses them as fantasy. Meanwhile, Burden's wife, Jenny, has suspicions of her own. She believes that the Rahmans, a highly respectable immigrant family from Pakistan, may be forcing their daughter, Tamima, into an arranged marriage -- or worse.</p><p>In <i>The Monster in the Box</i>, the twenty-second book in the Inspector Wexford series, fans will be thrilled to meet the now-aging inspector in the robust early days of his career.

The strange relationship, if it could be called that, had gone on for years, decades, and he had never breathed a word about it. He had kept silent because he knew no one would believe him. None of it could be proved, not the stalking, not the stares, the conspiratorial smiles, not the killings, not any of the signs Targo had made because he knew that Wexford knew and could do nothing about it. </p><p>It had gone on for years and then it had stopped. Or seemed to have stopped. Targo was gone. Back to Birmingham yet again or perhaps to Coventry. A long time had passed since he had been seen in Kingsmarkham, and Wexford had thought it was all over. Thought with regret, not relief, because if Targo disappeared&#x2014;more to the point, if Targo never did it again&#x2014;what hope had he of bringing the man to justice? Still, he had almost made up his mind he would never see him anymore. He would never again set eyes on that short, muscular figure with the broad shoulders and the thick, sturdy legs, the coarse, fairish hair, blunt features, and bright blue eyes&#x2014;and the mark that must always be kept covered up. Wexford had only once seen him without the scarf he wore wrapped round his neck, a wool scarf in winter, a cotton or silk one in summer, a scarf that belonged to one of his wives perhaps, no matter so long as it covered that purple-brown birthmark which disfigured his neck, crept up to his cheek, and dribbled down to his chest. He had seen him only once without a scarf, never without a dog. </p><p>Eric Targo. Older than Wexford by seven or eight years, a much-married man, van driver, property developer, kennels proprietor, animal lover, murderer. It was coincidence or chance&#x2014;Wexford favoured the latter&#x2014;that he was thinking about Targo for the first time in weeks, wondering what had happened to him, pondering and dismissing the rumour that he was back living in the area, regretting that he had never proved anything against him, when the man appeared in front of him, a hundred yards ahead. There was no doubt in his mind, even at that distance, even though Targo&#x2019;s shock of hair was quite white now. He still strutted, straight-backed, the way a short man carries himself, and he still wore a scarf. In his left hand, on the side nearest to Wexford, he carried a laptop computer. Or, to be accurate, a case made to hold a laptop. </p><p>Wexford was in his car. He pulled to the side of Glebe Road and switched off the engine. Targo had got out of a white van and gone into a house on the same side as Wexford was parked. No dog? Wexford had to decide whether he wanted Targo to see him. Perhaps it hardly mattered. How long was it? Ten years? More? He got out of the car and began to walk in the direction of the house Targo had gone into. It was one of a terrace between a jerry-built block of flats and a row of small shops, an estate agent, a nail bar, a newsagent, and a shop called Webb and Cobb (a name which always made Wexford smile) once selling pottery and kitchen utensils but now closed down and boarded up. Mike Burden had lived here once, when he was first married to his first wife; number 36, Wexford remembered. Number 34 was the house Targo had gone into. The front door of Burden&#x2019;s old house was painted purple now, and the new residents had paved over their narrow strip of front garden to make a motorbike park, something Burden said he resented, as if he had any right to comment on what the present owners did to their property. It made Wexford smile to himself to think of it. </p><p>There was no sign of Targo. Wexford walked up to the offside of the van and looked through the driver&#x2019;s window. It was open about three inches, for the benefit of a smallish dog, white and a tawny colour, of a feathery-eared, long-coated breed he didn&#x2019;t recognise, sitting on the passenger seat. It turned its head to look at Wexford and let out a single, sharp yap, not loud, not at all angry. Wexford returned to his car and moved it up the road to a position on the opposite side to the white van between a Honda and a Vauxhall. From there he could command a good view of number 34. How long would Targo stay in there? And what had he been doing with the laptop or the laptop case? It seemed an unlikely place for any friend of Targo&#x2019;s to live. When he had last seen the owner of the whitish tawny dog and the white van, Targo had been doing well for himself, was a rich man, while Glebe Road was a humble street where several families of immigrants had settled and which Burden had moved out of as soon as he could afford to. </p><p>Wexford noted the number of the white van. He waited. It was, he thought, a very English sort of day, the air still, the sky a uniform white. On such a day, at much the same time of year, late summer, he had visited Targo&#x2019;s boarding kennels and seen the snake. The scarf round Targo&#x2019;s neck had been of black, green, and yellow silk, almost but not quite covering the birthmark, and the snake which he draped round it had been the same sort of colours, the pattern on its skin more intricate. Accident or design? Nothing Targo might do would surprise him. The first time he had seen him, years and years ago when both were young but Wexford was very young, Targo wore a brown wool scarf. It was winter and cold. The dog with him was a spaniel. What was it called? Wexford couldn&#x2019;t remember. He remembered the second encounter because that was the only time Targo had for a few minutes been without a scarf. He had opened the front door to Wexford, left him standing there while he picked a scarf, his wife&#x2019;s, off a hook and wound it round his neck. In those few seconds Wexford had seen the purple-brown naevus, shaped like a map of some unknown continent with peninsulas running out to his chest and headlands skimming his chin and cheek, uneven with valleys and mountain ranges, and then Targo had covered it.... </p><p>Now the front door of number 34 opened and the man emerged. He stood on the doorstep talking to a young Asian, the occupant or one of the occupants of the house. The young man, who wore jeans and a dazzlingly white shirt, was at least six inches taller than Targo, handsome, his skin a pale amber colour, his hair jet-black. Targo, Wexford noticed, might have grown old but he still had a young man&#x2019;s figure. The T-shirt he wore showed off his heavily muscled torso, and the black jeans emphasised his flat stomach. He had left the laptop behind. While he was in the house, he had taken off his blue-and-white scarf. Because it was warm, no doubt, and, incredibly, because it was no longer needed for concealment. The birthmark had gone. </p><p>For a moment Wexford asked himself if he could possibly have made the wrong identification. The yellow hair had gone white, he couldn&#x2019;t see the bright blue eyes. The purple naevus had been the distinguishing mark which primarily identified him. But, no, this was Targo all right, squat, stocky, muscular Targo with his cocky walk and his confident stance. The Asian man walked a few steps down the short path with him. He held out his hand, and after a short hesitation Targo took it. Asians shook hands a lot, Wexford had noted, friends meeting by chance in the street; always men, though, never women. Someone had told him the Asians at number 34 owned the defunct Webb and Cobb next door&#x2014;for what that was worth. No doubt they received rents from the tenants of the flats above. </p><p>Targo came across to the van, opened the driver&#x2019;s door, and climbed in. Wexford could just about see him stroke the dog&#x2019;s head, then briefly put his arm round it and give it a squeeze. If any doubt was left, the dog identified him. A memory came to Wexford from the quite distant past: the first Mrs. Targo, by then divorced, saying of her ex-husband, &#x201c;He likes animals better than people. Well, he doesn&#x2019;t like people at all.&#x201d; </p><p>The white van moved off. It might be unwise to follow it, Wexford thought. He hadn&#x2019;t much faith in his powers of following a vehicle without its driver spotting him. It would be easy enough to find out where Targo now lived, harder to say what use discovering his address would be. He sat there for a few moments longer, reflecting on how seeing Targo again had instantly made him aware of his own physical shortcomings. Yet when he had first seen him, all those years ago, he had been a tall, young policeman, very young and very fit, while Targo was squat and overmuscled and with that horrible facial mark. </p><p>Sometime in the years since they had last encountered each other, Targo must have had the naevus removed. It could be done with a laser, Wexford had read in a magazine article about new remedies for disfigurement and deformity. The man had been making a lot of money, and no doubt he had spent some of it on this improvement to his appearance as others had their noses reshaped and their breasts augmented. The stranger thing, he thought, was that Targo still sometimes wore a scarf even on a summer&#x2019;s day&#x2014;until he remembered and stripped it off. Did he feel cold without that neck covering he had been wearing for most of his life? </p><p>A girl was walking past Wexford&#x2019;s car, starting to cross the street between it and the Honda. She looked about sixteen, wore the dark blue skirt and white blouse with a blazer which constituted the uniform of Kingsmarkham Comprehensive and, covering her head, the hijab. In her case it was a plain headscarf, the same colour as her skirt, but unflattering as it was, it failed to spoil her looks. Her dark brown eyes, surmounted by fine shapely eyebrows, glanced briefly in his direction. She went towards the house Targo had come out of, took a key from the satchel she carried, and let herself in. Too old to be the daughter of the handsome young man. His sister? Perhaps. </p><p>Five minutes later Wexford was parking the car on his own garage drive. Instead of letting himself in by the front door, he walked round the back and surveyed his garden. It was a large garden, which Dora had been doing her best to keep tidy and under control since thei...</p></p><h2>Vampire Hunter D Volume 8: Mysterious Journey to the North Sea, Part Two</h2><p>Vampire lore dictates that the creatures of the night shun the sea... or do they? The picturesque coastal town of Florence was known for millennia as a pleasure resort for the Nobility. As retribution for their decadence, the cruel and beautiful vampire inhabitants were &#34;punished,&#34; driven out more than a thousand years ago by a solitary traveler in black.

He believed that knowledge cannot be divided into parts, that the world can be viewed only as an interlocking, complex system. This view complemented his life: he had reveled in the traditions and contrasts of his neighborhood, eschewed fame in favor of keeping his emotional and social development on track.</p><p>In an age characterized by violence, extraordinary personal alienation, and the disintegration of moral values, Quigley chose a life dedicated to rationality. He wanted an explanation that in its very categorization would give meaning to a history which was a record of constant change. Therefore the analysis had to include but not be limited to categories of subject areas of human activity. It had to describe change in categories expressed sequentially in time. It was a most ambitious effort to make history rationally understandable.</p><p>On such views, in 1961 Quigley published <em>The Evolution of Civilizations</em>. Its scope was wide-ranging, covering the whole of man's activities throughout time. It attempted a categorization of man's activities in sequential fashion so as to provide a causal explanation of the stages of civilization.</p><p>In 1966, Quigley published <em>Tragedy and Hope</em>, a work of exceptional scholarship depicting the history of the world between 1895 and 1965. It was a commanding work, 20 years in the writing, that added to Quigley's considerable national reputation as a historian. The book reflected Quigley's feeling that "Western civilization is going down the drain." That was the tragedy. When the book came out in 1966, Quigley thought the whole show could he salvaged; that was his hope.</p><p>In the last 12 years of his life, from 1965 to 1977, Quigley taught, observed the American scene, and reflected on his basic values in life. He was simultaneously pessimistic and radically optimistic. Teaching was the core of his professional life and neither his craving to write nor his discouragement with student reaction of the early seventies diminished his commitment to the classroom.</p><p>Unlike his underlying faith in the efficacy of teaching, Quigley found little basis for optimism about the future of American society: "We are living in a very dangerous age in which insatiably greedy men are prepared to sacrifice anybody's health and tranquility to satisfy their own insatiable greed for money and power."</p><p>In the fields of economics we have great recognition for names likes Keynes or Friedman. Professor Quigley, though a top American historian, has escaped our attention. This book, which is a compilation of some of Quigley's writings and most important lectures, is an attempt to fill the void.</p></p><p></p><h2>Travail and Triumph (The Russians, Book 3)</h2><p>The aristocratic Fedorcenko family of St. Petersburg and a humble peasant family from Katyk, the Burenins, both face an uncertain future when revolutionaries plot to overthrow the tsar</p><p><b>The Russia They Know Is Crumbling.

Maybe it's not his.''</p><p>``Dr. Fallon--''</p><p>Diane Fallon, director of RiverTrail Museum of Natural History, looked up from the work she was trying to finish to see the spectacle of Gary and Samantha, two university students, balancing between a ladder and a construction platform, holding the skull of a giant sloth tilted at an odd angle atop its fifteen-foot skeleton. She raked her gaze over the offending skull as Gary was trying to wire it in place. ``Wait a minute,'' she said.</p><p>Diane climbed the ladder to the platform to have a look at the problem. She glanced at her watch as she lay down on her stomach on the platform. It was late and she was tired. She inspected the bones and shook her head and pointed to the neck of the giant creature. ``You have the atlas on backward.''</p><p>``Are you sure?''</p><p>``Yes, Gary, I'm sure. Bones are like puzzle pieces. When they're put together right, they fit together perfectly. How do you think your head would fit if your neck was on backward?'' The other students giggled. ``Did you follow the diagram I gave you?''</p><p>``Yes... I thought we did. I already have it wired in place.'' He said this as if expecting Diane to say, ``Well, then, I guess we'll just have to make the head fit, won't we?''</p><p>``You'll have to redo it.''</p><p>``It's getting late, Dr. Fallon. I've got a big test tomorrow to study for.''</p><p>``The opening of the exhibit is tomorrow evening. Test or no test, we have to finish this display. You've known the schedule since the beginning of the semester. Lay the skull here on the platform, gently. Unwire the atlas and put it on correctly. Follow the diagram.''</p><p>``Ah, man,'' Gary whined.</p><p>Samantha looked close to tears. Diane could hear the frustration in their voices, but there was nothing else to do. The exhibit had to be finished and they were aware of the timeline.</p><p>Leslie, the third of the student threesome, looked at her watch as Diane stepped down off the ladder. ``It is getting late,'' she said.</p><p>``I realize this is terribly unfair.'' Diane pulled loose a piece of packing tape that had stuck to her slacks. ``Normally, students get to ask fellow students which teachers are a bitch to work for, but I'm new at the museum and have no track record. You guys can spread the word. Do the work assigned, do it correctly and on time. I give only A's and F's. We miss the opening, it's an F.'' The three students' eyes widened in surprise. ``You've already wired the entire postcranial skeleton and done a good job. Getting the head on straight won't take as long as you think.''</p><p>``Dr. Fallon, telephone.'' Andie, her assistant, brought the cordless phone from Diane's office. Diane took it and retreated across the room away from the grumbling students.</p><p>``Yes?''</p><p>``Diane, how are you?'' It was a voice she hadn't heard in three years, and she was surprised that the sound of it made her smile.</p><p>``Frank? Frank, I'm... fine. And you? It's been a while.''</p><p>``I'm good.'' He hesitated half a beat. ``I wrote you several letters.''</p><p>``I didn't receive them.'' </p><p>``I didn't mail them.''</p><p>``Oh.''</p><p>``Could I take you to dinner?'' he asked. ``There are some things I'd like to talk with you about.''</p><p>``I don't know. This is a bad time, Frank.''</p><p>He hesitated again. ``I hate to ask a favor of you over the phone.''</p><p>``A favor? What is it?'' Diane looked over at her students busily working on the sloth exhibit. She hoped she had sufficiently put the fear of God into them so that they wouldn't mess up again.</p><p>``I have a bone that may belong to a missing girl....''</p><p>Diane's voice caught in her throat. ``A bone? No,'' she said a little too roughly, almost choking on the words.</p><p>``No, what?''</p><p>Andie was standing in front of her, holding out two handfuls of artificial leaves. The interruption gave her mind time to think and her racing heart time to slow down.</p><p>``Hold on just a moment, Frank.'' Diane placed a hand over the mouthpiece and raised her eyebrows at Andie.</p><p>``They sent the wrong plants, Archaeopteris, but Donald insists we go ahead and use them. He says no one will know the difference.''</p><p>``That's why we're here--to teach them the difference. Tell him this is a museum of natural history, not a B-grade movie set--we have to be accurate.''</p><p>Andie smiled. ``That's about what I told him you'd say.''</p><p>``I'm sorry, Frank. We're opening a big exhibit tomorrow evening and I'm up to my ears.''</p><p>``What do you mean, no?''</p><p>``No, I don't do that anymore.''</p><p>``Don't do what?''</p><p>``Forensic work. I don't do it anymore.''</p><p>There was such a long stretch of silence on the phone that Diane thought he might have hung up. ``You still there?''</p><p>``But that's what you do,'' he said.</p><p>``Not anymore.''</p><p>``Look, this is off the record. It's only one bone.''</p><p>``I don't care. There are other bone experts you can take it to. Get them... One bone? You have only one damn bone? There's probably nothing I could do with that anyway.''</p><p>``It's half a bone, really. You can tell me if it's human.''</p><p>``If that's all you want to know, any decent osteology student can tell you that.'' If you can find one, she thought, watching hers fumble with the sloth. ``But I can't do it.''</p><p>``It may belong to someone I know. I play poker with the missing girl's father. He's been my best friend since we were kids, and his daughter baby-sat Kevin. The police are treating this as a runaway, but the girl's parents are afraid her boyfriend has done something to her. Her brother found the bone in the woods behind her boyfriend's parents' home.''</p><p>In the woods, Diane thought. ``No.''</p><p>``Diane...''</p><p>``I have to go, Frank. I'm working with some students, and if they see me talking on the phone, they'll want to do it too. It's good to hear your voice again. It really is. Come by sometime.'' She hung up.</p><p>Diane stood still for a moment. Hearing Frank's voice was good. The tenor of it brought back past feelings--of warmth and passion. Why did he have to be talking about bones? She filled her lungs with air to clear her head, exhaled and went back to her students.</p><p></p><p>It was almost ten o'clock before the last person left. Diane was alone in the museum--but not completely alone. Jake Houser and Leonard Starns, the two night security guards, were making their rounds. And somewhere in the three-story structure the cleaning crew was hard at work.</p><p>Everything was almost ready for the reception the next evening--just a few odds and ends left. Diane walked among the exhibits representing North America in the Pleistocene. The skeleton of a huge Bison antiquus stood, as if on the ancient tundra, against the background of a restored mural of a grazing herd, oblivious to the Paleo-Indians hiding in the tall grass with their Clovis point-tipped spears.</p><p>The giant sloth turned out not to be the disaster she had feared. It stood majestic among prehistoric flora, head on straight, looking out at the skeleton of Mammothus columbi several feet in front of it. Something in the mammoth exhibit caught her eye. Archaeopteris leaves sprouting around the mammoth's feet. Donald, damn him, had put the wrong vegetation in anyway. He was such a willful... She stepped over the barrier rope carefully and took up the plants. A loud knock on the front doors brought her head up with a start.</p><p>She leaned over to look through the double doorway into the museum lobby. Jake appeared from the direction of the primate room.</p><p>``I'll get it, Dr. Fallon,'' he called out as he pressed the intercom button. ``The museum is closed,'' he said into the speaker.</p><p>``Hey, Jake, it's Frank.''</p><p>Frank Duncan. So he wasn't giving up. Diane heard the clank of keys in the door and their voices.</p><p>``Frank, what the hell you doing around here this late?''</p><p>``Checking up on your moonlighting. Might try it myself. You get to sleep a lot, I hear.''</p><p>She heard them both laugh.</p><p>``How's that boy of yours?'' asked Frank. ``In an Ivy League school, isn't he?''</p><p>She still couldn't see Frank, but Jake had turned so she could see his face. He was a lean-looking man, at home with a scowl, but a large grin pushed his deep frown lines upward.</p><p>``Dylan's great. You know he graduated? With honors. I have this cousin who's always bragging about his boys being first in our family to get a college education.'' Jake laughed. ``The twins went to community college. Dylan went to Harvard.''</p><p>Diane listened as Jake and Frank talked about Jake's son. She liked the normalcy of their conversation--so far removed from recent events in her life. Coming here to the museum was the right decision.</p><p>``What's he going to do now he's graduated?'' asked Frank.</p><p>``Looks like he's going to be accepted to Harvard Business School. They don't just take everybody right out of college, you know. Most of the time they wait till they've worked a bit. See who's rising to the top. I'm real proud of the boy.''</p><p>``What I can't figure,'' said Frank, ``is where he got his brains.''</p><p>``Not from his daddy, that's for sure. I told Carol it's a good thing he looks like me, or I'd be suspicious. How's your Kevin?''</p><p>``Growing. He's in eighth grade now. I'm glad I have a while before I have to start shelling out for college tuition.''</p><p>``I hear you there.''</p><p>``Diane Fallon here?'' asked Frank.</p><p>Jake turned and looked in her direction. ``Yes, she's here.''</p><p>Diane was still standing underneath the huge tusks of the mammoth. She watched Detective Frank Duncan of the Metro-Atlanta Fraud and Computer Forensics Unit set down a briefcase at the door and cross the wide marble lobby into the Pleistocene room. He had the same handsomeness, the same smile, the same familiar face--perhaps just a little older than the last time she saw him.</p><p>``Nice,'' he said, reaching up and brushing the tips of his fingers along the bottom of a gigantic curved tusk. It reminded her of that Celine Dion song--``It's All Coming Back to Me Now.''</p><p>``Did these things used to roam the neighborhood?'' he asked.</p><p>``Up until about ten thousand years ago.''</p><p>``Long gone, eh?''</p><p>``A mere blink of an eye in the grand scheme of things.''</p><p>He stood under the head and tusks of the mammoth with her, his eyes searching her face. ``You look good. Damn good.''</p><p>Diane brushed a loose strand of hair out of her eyes. ``Too much time in the sun. My face is looking like parchment.''</p><p>Frank shook his head. ``A few lines around the eyes and mouth only give you character. You're a little thin, maybe. Didn't they feed you in South America? You're all right, aren't you? Didn't pick up anything?''</p><p>``No, Frank, I didn't pick up anything. I'm fine.''</p><p>Frank tilted his head to one side, inspecting her wrist and arm. ``A fellow I know came back from the Amazon and he had this insect bite on his arm that wouldn't go away. Swelled up, started itching and turned black. When he couldn't stand the itch any longer, he went to the doctor. The doctor thought it was a boil and started to lance it. Just as he touched the skin with his scalpel,'' Frank touched his finger gently to her forearm, ``the thing burst open and this big, black, ugly fly crawled out of his arm and flew off. Disgusting.'' He tickled her skin with the tips of his fingers.</p><p>Diane pulled her arm back reflexively, but smiled despite herself. ``You haven't changed. What are you doing at the museum this late?''</p><p>His eyes were smiling again, searching her face. ``I just got off from work. I was passing this way.''</p><p>``Don't tell me that. You don't pass this place going anywhere.'' She stepped out of the exhibit, still holding the artificial leaves like an odd bouquet.</p><p>``It's been a couple of years....'' he began.</p><p>``Three years.''</p><p>``I wanted to see you. How about a late dinner?''</p><p>He was wearing jeans and a navy sweater and smelled like aftershave. He hadn't just stopped off from work. Diane wished she didn't feel so comforted by that realization. She lay the leaves next to the exhibit and dusted off her hands, aware that she must have the aroma of the day's accumulation of glue, paint and perspiration. ``How about you telling me why you're really here?''</p><p>``I really came to see you. Talking with you got me worried about you. What happened? Why did you give up your career?''</p><p>``I changed jobs. People do that.'' Diane turned away from his gaze and started toward the Bison antiquus. ``I need to check out the exhibits before I leave.

They were, however, very different personalities. Kingsley was charming, sociable, and completely amoral whilst Larkin was awkward and insecure. Their relationship with one another is fascinating in part because it provided the inspiration behind their work. In fact, parts of <i>Lucky Jim</i> were based on Larkin's life, a fact the poet begrudged for the rest of his life. An extraordinary study of one of the most controversial literary friendships of the twentieth century.</p></p><p>Richard Bradford: Richard Bradford has authored biographies of Kingsley Amis (Lucky Him 978 0720611175), Philip Larkin (First Boredom, Then Fear 978 0720613254) and Martin Amis (978 1605983851).<br><br></p><h2>A Flower Fairy Alphabet (Serendipity Books)</h2><p>For the first time in over 10 years all eight Original Flower Fairies Books have been re-designed.</p><p>Cicely Mary Barker was born in Croydon, South London in 1895 and died in 1973. She found international acclaim as an artist with her delightful Flower Fairies books the first of which, Flower Fairies of the Spring, was printed in 1923.<p> THE SONG OF THE APPLE BLOSSOM FAIRIES</p> <p> Up in the tree we see you, blossom-babies, All pink and white; We think there must be fairies to protect you From frost and blight, Until, some windy day, in drifts of petals, You take your flight.</p> <p> You'll fly away! But if we wait with patience, Some day we'll find Here, in your place, full-grown and ripe, the apples You left behind- A goodly gift indeed, from blossom-babies To human-kind!</p></p><h2>Zvi</h2><p>ZVI is the biography of a man who, like his nation Israel, defies explanation apart from God. His story in the early stages is reminiscent of the Book of Esther in the Bible--God is not consciously represented, yet He is obviously present and at work. <p>One will recognize, as the story unfolds, that people and events touched Zvi's life at strategic points in ways that cannot be coincidental. Over the tortuous course he followed in his flight for survival, the reader will discern a clear pattern of divine provision. </p><p>Unlike many of the stories that confront us today, this true-life epic has a satisfying climax. Zvi's life is far from over, of course, but the issue has been settled. He is alive today and living a joyfully triumphant life in the land of his fathers. </p><p>How he survived the Holocaust, found his way to the shores of Israel, and faced his life-transforming encounter with the Messiah is a story one can ill afford to miss. A careful study of his life is a revelation of the lengths to which a loving Lord will go to bring one soul safely home.</p></p><p>ELWOOD MCQUAID was greatly influenced by two Hebrew Christians--Dr. Hyman Appleman and Dr. Victor Buksbazen--who helped direct the course for his ministry to Jewish people.

(Outdoor Literature) Who hasnt wanted to get away from cell phones, e-mail, roads, and traffic? And what better place to escape our wired world than the far northwestern corner of Canadas Northwest Territories and a river that flows through uninhabited country, 400 miles to the Arctic Ocean. But what if your canoeing partner brings along a satellite phone to use in case of an emergency? And, struck by the novelty of anywhere-on-earth communication, he proceeds to use the phone to check in with his law office, his wife, kids, sisters, father, and friends? Noted wilderness traveler and author Ted Kerasote deals with just such a situation as he journeys along the Horton River through the largest ice-free, roadless area left on Earth, a stunning wilderness of grizzly bears, caribou, and migrating birds. Between navigating rapids, slipping around musk ox and grizzlies, and being pinned down by Arctic storms, the two friends prod each other into a finer understanding of love, marriage, parenting, and the meaning of solitude in an increasingly wired world. Contrasting his own experiences with those of the regions earliest explorers--Sir John Franklin and Vilhjalmur Stefansson--Kerasote provides a compelling and humorous take on how travelers from any age adjust to being away from their civilizations and how getting &#34;out there&#34; has inevitably changed but has also remained the same--especially if you shut off the phone.</p><p>Ted Kerasote is a regular contributor to &#34;Outside,&#34; &#34;Audubon&#34;, and other magazines and is the author of several books. He has participated in and led many backcountry trips, including mountaineering, desert and jungle crossings, skiing, dog sledding, river descents by canoe and kayak, and ocean sea kayaking. These trips have taken place all over the globe.The current carries us swiftly past the pilot and the three anglers downstream, all of whom are playing leaping grayling. An instant later, we&#x2019;re swept around a bend and out of sight. The country immediately becomes so empty it seems as if we&#x2019;re the first people on Earth. <p>Even after spending many years in the outdoors, in some very remote places, I always find this sudden change in consciousness a jolt. It&#x2019;s as if an unseen hand has literally flipped a switch in the universe. One moment I&#x2019;m embedded in a world where motorized conveyances offer a quick escape to comfort and safety. The next, I&#x2019;m free-floating in a world from which escape is extremely difficult&#x2014;or was until the advent of global satellite phones. </p><p>The Arctic landscape hasn&#x2019;t changed since I first saw it two decades ago&#x2014;shoreline sedges, dense willow, a moirï¿½ of green tundra, rippling and shimmering away toward hills dappled with the shadows of cumulus clouds&#x2014;but I have to admit that the country&#x2019;s old edginess is gone. The mixture of genuine fear at being alone in the vastness of the high latitudes, and the lovely tension of facing that fear with no resources other than what we&#x2019;ve brought along and the wit inspired by necessity, is diminished. The air taxi service&#x2019;s telephone number is programmed into Len&#x2019;s satphone and is no more than the push of a memory button away. The entire rescue services of North America would then be at our disposal, down to a huge, twin-rotor helicopter that can navigate through fog and find us by Global Positioning System coordinates. Len, leaving nothing to chance, has also accepted the offer of a handheld GPS from his law partner&#x2014;a device that, with another push of a button, tells you your! latitude and longitude, bouncing its signal from satellites circling overhead. </p><p>All this technology doesn&#x2019;t mean that we&#x2019;ll be less careful. Getting pinned in a rapid with your head underwater takes only a few seconds of inattention, and then all the satphones and GPSs in the world won&#x2019;t do you a bit of good. Nevertheless, the phone has given us a newfound cushion and is extinguishing an awareness that&#x2019;s always been part of these trips, what I like to think of as slipping through the world&#x2019;s harshness by a mixture of skill and divine grace.</p></p><h2>A Hiss Before Dying: A Mrs. Murphy Mystery</h2><p><b>Rita Mae Brown and her feline co-author Sneaky Pie Brown are back chasing mystery with their unique circle of Southern sleuths. And though the changing colors of fall are a beauty to behold, this year the scattered leaves hide a grim surprise.&nbsp;</b><br><br><b>&#x201c;As feline collaborators go, you couldn&#x2019;t ask for better than Sneaky Pie Brown.&#x201d;<i>&#x2014;The New York Times Book Review</i></b>&nbsp;<br><br> Autumn is in the air in the Blue Ridge Mountain community of Crozet, Virginia&#x2014;and all the traditions of the changing seasons are under way. Mary Minor &#x201c;Harry&#x201d; Haristeen cleans her cupboards, her husband, Fair, prepares the horses for the shorter days ahead, and the clamorous barking of beagles signals the annual rabbit chase through the central Virginia hills. But the last thing the local beaglers and their hounds expect to flush out is a dead body.&nbsp;<br><br> Disturbingly, it&#x2019;s the second corpse to turn up, after that of a missing truck driver too disfigured to identify. The deaths seem unrelated&#x2014;until Harry picks up a trail of clues dating back to the state&#x2019;s post-Revolutionary past.<br><br> The echoes of the Shot Heard Round the World pale in comparison to the dangerous shootout Harry narrowly escapes unscathed. Next time, it may be the <i>killer</i> who gets lucky. But not if Harry&#x2019;s furry friends Mrs. Murphy, Pewter, and Tucker can help it.

Two cats and one dog walked in the pleasant sixty-ï¿½degree weather toward the barns, the Blue Ridge Mountains at their backs.<br><br>The bottom rim of the sun, hovering over the spine of the mountains, would soon dip down, ushering in an explosive sunset followed by a beautiful twilight. The changing seasons specialized in twilights of various blues.<br><br>Animals moved about as day gave way to night. Day hunters and feeders headed for home, the night creatures popped their heads out of dens, stuck beaks out of tree hollows, preparing for activity. The deer moved toward their sleeping places, which were usually sheltered from the winds in a thicket. Even the beavers stopped timbering, carrying a few thinner branches toward their lodge. That would be tomorrow&#x2019;s task, trimming the branches.<br><br>Mrs. Murphy, the tiger cat; green-ï¿½eyed Pewter, the overlarge gray cat; and Tee Tucker, the intrepid corgi, relished this time of day. With a few barks from Tucker, the retiring deer bolted as the domesticated animals chased after them. Deer were so much bigger, to see them scatter away just puffed up the three amigos. A few harsh words might be exchanged with the fox whose den extended under the roots of an ancient walnut.<br><br>The turtles, the salamanders, the fish and crayfish prepared for night. When they sat by the creek, the cats would stare at the freshwater creatures, but in the main they found the fish boring. Birds, on the other hand, squawked, chattered, spit seeds, dropped earthworms on them, cussed the cats unmercifully.<br><br>A blue jay looked down from a poplar tree. &#x201c;Empty-ï¿½handed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We weren&#x2019;t hunting.&#x201d; Pewter detested that bird.<br><br>&#x201c;You couldn&#x2019;t catch a mouse if your life depended on it. Fat, fat, water rat,&#x201d; the handsome bird taunted.<br><br>Before Pewter could return the insult, Tucker looked up. She&#x2019;d heard the sound wind makes through feathers built for speed as opposed to feathers designed for stealth.<br><br>Overhead, not too far, a fully grown bald eagle carried bloody flesh in its talons.<br><br>The three froze. Even the blue jay shut up.<br><br>The eagle tucked its wings close to its body and made a taunting dive toward the three pets, who flattened on the lane. At the last minute, the bird opened its wings, a span seemingly as long as a Cadillac, turned slightly, and with one mighty, taunting flap, off he flew.<br><br>&#x201c;Did you see what he had?&#x201d; Mrs. Murphy asked. &#x201c;All I saw was bloody flesh.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A piece of rawhide hung from above his talon.&#x201d; The dog looked at the huge bird fast disappearing, thanks to his uncommon speed.<br><br>&#x201c;An eyeball. He carried an eyeball in his talon hanging from the flesh,&#x201d; the sharp-ï¿½eyed blue jay informed them. &#x201c;It was swinging. Blue. A blue eyeball. As blue as my feathers.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sometimes a horse will have blue eyes,&#x201d; Tucker mentioned.<br><br>&#x201c;Human, a human eyeball. They&#x2019;re easy to identify, really. Somewhere out there is a person with half a face,&#x201d; the blue jay proclaimed, opened wide his own wings, lifted off toward the house.<br><br>The three looked at one another, then resumed walking ï¿½toward the house and the barn.<br><br>Tucker, puzzled, wondered, &#x201c;Maybe the rawhide held the eagle. You know, he was somebody&#x2019;s pet and he got loose.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tucker, a person would have to be crazy to keep a bald eagle. They&#x2019;re ferocious, huge, and wild,&#x201d; Mrs. Murphy replied.<br><br>&#x201c;We were once saber-ï¿½toothed tigers.&#x201d; Pewter puffed out her chest.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, and you sold out for tuna,&#x201d; Tucker teased.<br><br>&#x201c;Better than Milk-ï¿½Bones. Dogs are really dumb,&#x201d; Pewter shot back.<br><br>The dog and gray cat argued past the pastures and paddocks. The horses kept eating. They&#x2019;d heard it all before, including knock-ï¿½down, drag-ï¿½out fights in the barn when the two would chase each other, buckets flying, brushes, even halters, pulled off their hooks.<br><br>Mrs. Murphy generally exhibited more decorum.<br><br>They pushed through the animal door at the large screened-ï¿½in porch, then through the door into the kitchen, which also had an animal door.<br><br>In the kitchen, every cabinet door above the sink was open, dishes stacked on the counters.<br><br>Mary Minor Haristeen, &#x201c;Harry,&#x201d; stood on a half ladder, wiping down the interior of the cabinets with a wet rag. This was to have been a short task. That was three hours ago.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t step on the dishes,&#x201d; she admonished the cats, already on the counter.<br><br>&#x201c;These are old bowls. Throw them out,&#x201d; Pewter advised. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to keep everything. Look how chipped this stuff is.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was her mother&#x2019;s,&#x201d; Mrs. Murphy said.<br><br>&#x201c;Guess what? Her mother isn&#x2019;t here to see it. I am. I don&#x2019;t want to eat out of old bowls. I&#x2019;m a modern cat.&#x201d; Pewter sat beside the stacked bowls, tempted to push them off the counter.<br><br>Through the window over the sink in the setting sun, Pewter saw her blue jay nemesis settle on an overhanging tree branch. The bird turned his head to the right, then to the left to afford a clear view.<br><br>&#x201c;Fatty!&#x201d; he shrieked.<br><br>Pewter charged the window, nearly knocking the bowls to the floor, spit loudly, and slammed a paw into the window.<br><br>The jay giggled, then hopped up a branch, closer to the window.<br><br>&#x201c;I will kill him!&#x201d; Pewter promised.<br><br>&#x201c;Get off here. You nearly knocked Mom&#x2019;s bowls over,&#x201d; Harry chided.<br><br>Harry climbed down the half ladder, put the rag in the sink, wiped her hands. Then she picked up the bowls, climbed back up, and slid them into place. She repeated this until everything she&#x2019;d put on the counters was back in place.<br><br>Just as she finished, the back door opened and her tall neighbor, Cynthia Cooper, a deputy in the sheriff&#x2019;s department, stepped inside.<br><br>&#x201c;Now you come over. I could have used you to put away this stuff.&#x201d; Harry pointed to the cabinets.<br><br>&#x201c;A cleaning fit.&#x201d; Cooper nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;Fall and spring. Best time.&#x201d; Harry stepped down, folding the ladder.<br><br>&#x201c;You say.&#x201d; Cooper leaned over to pet Tucker.<br><br>&#x201c;Sit down. Hey, look at the sunset before you do.&#x201d;<br><br>Cooper walked over to look through the sink window. &#x201c;Like someone tossed a match into the sky.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I never get tired of sunsets, or sunrises, for that matter. Get off work early?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. It&#x2019;s six-ï¿½twenty. Tell you what, it&#x2019;s been a long day.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Accidents?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dad&#x2019;s home!&#x201d; Tucker rushed outside through the animal doors to greet Fair Haristeen, all six feet five inches of him.<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s so obsequious.&#x201d; Pewter pouted.<br><br>Fair stepped inside the screened-ï¿½in porch, stomped his boots to remove the dust, then opened the kitchen door. &#x201c;Hi, honey.&#x201d; He kissed Harry on the cheek, then kissed Cooper, too. &#x201c;Never pass up the chance to kiss a pretty woman.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the worst.&#x201d; Cooper laughed at him even as she enjoyed the attention.<br><br>Fair was one of those men people liked, men and women.<br><br>&#x201c;You know, honey, I actually understand that,&#x201d; Harry responded and laughed. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;ll have you know you&#x2019;ve walked into a better organized kitchen. Anyone want a drink? Tea?&#x201d; Harry offered.<br><br>&#x201c;Too late for tea, but if you have a beer, I will indulge, and I owe you a six-ï¿½pack,&#x201d; Cooper promised.<br><br>&#x201c;You do not.&#x201d; Harry pulled out glasses and three beers.<br><br>&#x201c;We saw an eyeball!&#x201d; Pewter wanted attention so she jumped on Fair&#x2019;s lap. &#x201c;It was bloody. A big, blue eyeball.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The bald eagle had it.&#x201d; Tucker filled in detail.<br><br>Harry, wisely, put down some treats. Pewter liked Fair, but dried chicken twists trumped affection.<br><br>&#x201c;How cold is it supposed to get tonight?&#x201d; Cooper asked. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t had time to check the weather on my phone. Like I said, a long day.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No frost. We usually get the first frost mid-ï¿½October, but it&#x2019;s warmish right now,&#x201d; Fair replied.<br><br>&#x201c;Which reminds me, time to close in the screened-ï¿½in porch,&#x201d; Harry noted. &#x201c;We can do it this weekend and then switch the horses&#x2019; schedule.&#x201d;<br><br>The horses remained out at night in the summers, and inside out of the sun during the day, with the reverse rotating in the cold months when fall truly arrived.<br><br>&#x201c;They look good. I noticed driving in how shiny their coats are,&#x201d; Cooper complimented Harry, who took care of them.<br><br>&#x201c;Curry comb. Hair is starting to grow. They&#x2019;re getting ready for the cold. I just brush out the dirt, then brush with a smoother combination, and bingo, they shine like patent leather. Good food helps, too, like some rice bran. Anyway, you said it was a busy day. If it wasn&#x2019;t accidents, robberies?&#x201d;<br><br>Cooper smiled. &#x201c;No. But I got a call from our dispatcher, go to Route 250 right at the top of Afton Mountain before it plunges down the east side. Two-ï¿½fifty has a hell of a grade. Drove up there. Nothing urgent, just a call for an extra pair of eyes. Got there and here is this big transport loaded with brand-ï¿½new Volvos, motor running, everything fine but no driver. No one in sight. The keys were in the ignition, the emergency brake was on, nothing was damaged. We checked his shipping papers. He was on his way down to Volvo of Charlottesville. Called them. He was due in. No one had heard a thing. We called Louisville, Kentucky, where he&#x2019;d picked up the freight. Everything was fine. No driver. No cellphone. Only shipping paperwork.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s odd,&#x201d; Harry said.<br><br>&#x201c;His wallet was in the truck. Sunglasses. Not a thing touched that we could tell.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What did you do?&#x201d; Fair thought it peculiar, too.<br><br>&#x201c;The Volvo dealer sent up three men, one to drive, one as a passenger, and one to follow. Luckily there was someone in the dealership that could handle that big boat. As there was no crime, no report, we thought it best to get the new cars to the dealer,&#x201d; Cooper added. &#x201c;We looked around for the driver. No sign of him. As a precaution, we dusted the cab for fingerprints.&#x201d;<br><br>Harry, ever imaginative, thought out loud. &#x201c;He could have been carrying contraband.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, they go through every new vehicle to prepare it. If something is amiss, I reckon we&#x2019;ll know. But, poof, just disappeared with that big rig idling by the side of the road.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe he stopped to go to the bathroom and had a heart attack,&#x201d; Fair offered.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll have bona fide search teams out tomorrow. It&#x2019;s rugged terrain. Really, could be just what you said, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean we&#x2019;ll find him easily.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Coop, someone might have picked him up,&#x201d; Harry, always excited by a mystery no matter how tiny or removed from her own life, said.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; Cooper shrugged.<br><br>&#x201c;Just think, what if that had been a Brink&#x2019;s truck, a truck jammed with bags of money?&#x201d; Harry grinned. &#x201c;An unlocked truck.&#x201d;<br><br>Fair laughed. &#x201c;I remember when I was in third grade. Dad and I were down on Main Street, we&#x2019;d walked back to Water Street, and a truck full of beer turned over. Cans rolling everywhere. I mean in minutes half the male population of Charlottesville was there scooping up them cans.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;See, there are good accidents,&#x201d; Harry said and laughed.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I saw an eyeball. That&#x2019;s not a good accident.&#x201d; A tidbit of dried chicken fell out of the side of Pewter&#x2019;s mouth, as she loudly made her points.<br><br>&#x201c;Pewter, they don&#x2019;t care about eyeballs any more than you care about a rig full of new cars.&#x201d; Mrs. Murphy shrugged.<br><br>She was right. For now.<br><br>2<br><br>October 18, 2016 Tuesday<br><br>Crackling logs, the odor of sweet pearwood, gave the Virginians for Sustainable Wildlife meeting a cozy air. Harry hosted this month&#x2019;s gathering, which had started at 6:30 in the evening. The members took turns hosting, which brought them closer together. A few of the people had known one another for years, but others were new to Crozet, to central Virginia. Being invited into someone&#x2019;s home provided an opportunity to learn more about them, a sense of their taste, perhaps even their priorities. Anyone coming into Harry&#x2019;s living room might share a seat with Mrs. Murphy or Pewter, both loath to move. Tucker had the sense to sprawl on the floor.<br><br>Jessica Ligon, doctor of veterinary medicine, young, well-liked, finished up her report. &#x201c;So we&#x2019;re still seeing fleas and ticks. Granted, raccoons, possums, other quadrupeds deal with it. Fleas can give animals tapeworms. So when deer season starts and your house dog chews on a carcass left behind by an irresponsible hunter, then your dog gets an infestation. Just keep a lookout for them. But tapeworm is easy to purge, fortunately. Do the mammals have Lyme disease? I&#x2019;m sure some do.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t we break the cycle in the wildlife?&#x201d; MaryJo Cranston, an investment broker and the treasurer of the group, asked.<br><br>&#x201c;The horrendous expense, for one thing. Plus, MaryJo, you can&#x2019;t be sure the animals you want to purge of parasites are the ones ingesting the meds. An animal can carry the tick as well as be bitten by it. As for Lyme, we&#x2019;d have to trap them, get blood. If infected, it&#x2019;s an antibiotic protocol. Just can&#x2019;t do it with wild animals, as it takes so many consecutive days of pills. We&#x2019;d need to keep them in cages until the antibiotic cycle is complete; also, Lyme fatigues them. It&#x2019;s just close to impossible.&#x201d;<br><br>MaryJo, newer to the group, nodded. &#x201c;It does sound complicated.&#x201d;<br><br>Susan Tucker, president of the group and Harry&#x2019;s childhood friend, checked her notes. &#x201c;Jessica, thanks, we&#x2019;re always fascinated with new developments in veterinary medicine for all animals.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The research being done now is amazing, especially with stem cells.

This is the incredible account of an expedition he led on December 2,&nbsp;1911, from Hobart, to explore the virgin frozen coastline below, 2000 miles of which had never felt the tread of a human foot. After setting up Main Base at Cape Denision and Western Base on Queen Mary Land, he headed east on an extraordinary sledging trek with his companions, Belgrave Ninnis and Dr Xavier Mertz. After five weeks, tragedy struck&#x2014;Ninnis was swallowed whole by a snow-covered crevasse, and Mawson and Mertz realized it was too dangerous to go on. Dwindling supplies forced them to kill their dogs to feed the other dogs, at first, and then themselves. Hunger, sickness, and despair eventually got the better of Ninnis, and he succumbed to madness and then to death. Mawson found himself all alone, 160 miles from safety, with next to no food.&nbsp;This staggering tale of his survival, against all odds, also&nbsp;masterfully interweaves the stories of the other giants from the heroic age of polar exploration, to bring the jaw-dropping events of this bygone era dazzlingly back to life.</strong></p><p><b>Peter FitzSimons</b> is a journalist with the<i> Sun-Herald</i> and the&nbsp;<i>Sydney Morning Herald</i>, and the author of more than 20 books, including<i> How Hemlines Predict the Economy</i>.</p><h2>A Bargain for Frances (An I Can Read Book)</h2><p>Frances has saved up two dollars and seventeen cents.

Her childhood was spent in the centre of the Spanish reconquest and was dominated by her military hero of a father (St Ferdinand) and her prodigiously clever brother (King Alfonso X the Learned). Married at the age of twelve and a mother at thirteen, she gave birth to at least sixteen children, most of whom died young. She was a prisoner for a year amid a civil war in which her husband&#x2019;s life was in acute danger. Devoted to Edward, she accompanied him everywhere. All in all, she was to live for extended periods in five different countries.Eleanor was a highly dynamic, forceful personality who acted as part of Edward&#x2019;s innermost circle of advisers, and successfully accumulated a vast property empire for the English Crown. In cultural terms her influence in architecture and design &#x2013; and even gardening &#x2013; can be discerned to this day, while her idealised image still speaks to us from Edward&#x2019;s beautiful memorials to her, the Eleanor crosses.

Does cold cream or hot cream do a better job coaxing out the flavor of mint leaves or rose petals?

But where did Santa come from and how did he evolve into today's Jolly Old Saint Nick?</p><br><p>Well before the legendary poem "Twas the Night Before Christmas" shaped the modern vision of Santa Claus riding a flying sleigh pulled by magical reindeer, his story actually began about seventeen hundred years ago in the Eastern Roman Empire. There, a young orphan named Nicholas became famous for using his inheritance to give gifts to the needy. In his most wildly-known story, he threw bags of gold over a wall into the house of a destitute merchant, so that the man would not be forced to sell his daughters into slavery. Eventually, this young and holy man became the Bishop of Myra and lived a life of faith and miracles, fighting injustice and protecting the weak. Even after his death, his miracles continued, and he is credited with saving sailors, healing the sick, and even raising the dead. In time, he became known as St. Nicholas the Wonder Worker.&nbsp;</p><p>In the numerous centuries since the passing of Saint Nicholas, his story has grown, developed, and been combined with numerous other legends. In the Netherlands, he became known as Sinterklaas, the old man who brought presents to children with the help of his assistant Zwarte Piet. In England, he became Father Christmas, the living embodiment of the holiday. </p><p>Fully illustrated with original color drawings,&nbsp;The Story of Santa Claus celebrates the story of his beginnings as a holy man in Ancient Rome, through his development in the Middle-Ages, to his current, likeness on advertisements, greeting cards, apparel and decorations - right down to real-life mall-based family photo opp. It is a winding, magical tale filled with mystery and good will towards all men, sure to fill even the most jaded scrooges with a little bit of Christmas magic.</p></p><p>Joseph A McCullough is the author of several non-fiction books including A Pocket History of Ireland and Osprey&#39;s Zombies: A Hunter&#39;s Guide.

She carefully traces the debates about projective identification_the neurotic versus psychotic arguments and the intrapsychic versus interpersonal views. She holds that disagreements stem from unrecognized shifts in meaning of the term identification and unacknowledged differences of opinion as to where the identification takes place. For her, projective identification is an umbrella term for phenomena that can affect the self, the object inside the self, and the external object.<br>Dr. Scharff brings fresh insight to the neglected concept of introjective identification and a new understanding of the therapeutic action of projective and introjective identification.<br>The book's unique distinction is in the author's integration of object relations theory and practice, particularly with regard to the handling of countertransference. The clinical material is written in the vivid and personally candid style that is a hallmark of her work.<br>Dr. Scharff demonstrates how to understand and utilize projective and introjective identification, making this work indispensable for every dynamically oriented therapist.</p><p>Jill Scharff provides ample and detailed descriptions of her use of countertransference experience in the understanding of therapeutic interaction and formulation of interpretations and other therapeutic interventions. It is only in the rare instance that there are countertransference data of the sort provided by Scharff that it is possible to portray and analyze the moment-to-moment experience of being with a patient. I consider this book to be a major contribution to the analytic understanding of the therapeutic process . . . (Thomas Ogden, MD, The Psychoanalytic Institute of Northern California)<br><br>Most welcome of all for the reader is Dr. Scharff's ability to write with both liveliness and clarity. Her admirably scholarly review of relevant literature is distilled, for the reader, in readily understandable terms, as she enables us to follow the development of her authentically original views concerning projective and introjective identification_views based in part on the contributions of earlier writers, but in larger part on her own clinical experiences with patients in diverse treatment settings. Dr. Jill Scharff is an immensely creative clinician and writer who will, I am sure, illuminate other readers' lives and work as she has illuminated, for me, my own life and work. (Harold Searles)<br><br>By demonstrating how she uses the concepts of projective and introjective identification in her own work, Dr. Scharff has enlarged our vision and has enriched our understanding of the therapeutic process. A scholarly text, a teaching guide, a casebook for practitioners, this is a unique work that should be read by students and experienced therapists alike.

Bavier, who seeks revenge after Helene steals her lover</p><p></p><h2>Hidden Turnings: A Collection of Stories Through Time and Space</h2><p>A collection of twelve fantasy stories on the theme of the supernatural touching and changing everyday life.</p><p>The hidden turnings in these 12 stories include unexpected twists in space and occasionally time, along with the ability to "lead the reader around some hidden turning of the mind into remarkable new places," as noted by Jones in her introduction. Most of the stories run from 8 to 16 pages; among the contributors are Robert Westall, Helen Cresswell, and Tanith Lee. Themes and moods vary, but many of the stories speak with a decidedly British accent, which is entirely in harmony with tales of such wondrous folk as Garry Kilworth's "Dogfaerie" and the 13th-century monk who finds himself at a 20th-century rock festival in Mary Rayner's "The Vision." Jones appears as author as well as editor with "The Master," an unusual mix of horror fantasy and technological science fiction. The longest story is Roger Zelazny's "Kalifriki of the Thread," a masterfully constructed odyssey of hunter and prey through time and worlds utterly unlike our own. Some of the shorter stories could be useful read-alouds for a middle-school audience (usually horror fans to begin with).

"Not if we don't talk." Collin's index finger stroked the cleft of her sister's chin. Faith's body went numb. The locusts crescendoed to a frenzy in her brain. She wanted to sink into the fresh-mown lawn, but her feet rooted to the ground as firmly as the bush that hid her from view. Three years had done nothing to diminish his effect on her. He was grinning, studying her sister through heavy lids, obviously relaxed as he leaned against the wall of their wraparound porch. His serge morning coat was draped casually over the railing. The rolled sleeves of his starched, white shirt displayed muscled arms snug around Charity's waist. Faith knew all too well his clear, gray eyes held a maddening twinkle, and she heard the low rumble of his laughter when he pulled her sister close.</p><h2>Existentialism and Humanism</h2><p>This volume presents an English translation of a lecture Sartre delivered at the Club Maintenant, along with several pages of dialogue between Sartre and the auditors and critics of the lecture.</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Have a Little Faith: A True Story</h2><p>The best-selling author relates his efforts to eulogize a beloved rabbi who is near death, in a book where the author sits with and cares for the dying man, discovers and learns to admire an impoverished congregation, and rekindles his faith as he searches for the right words to honor the dying cleric.

His first novel, <em>The Five People You Meet in Heaven</em>, was an instant number-one <em>New York Times</em> bestseller that has since sold more than six million copies worldwide. <em>For One More Day</em>, his second novel, was also a #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestseller. Both books were made into acclaimed TV films. Mitch also works as a columnist and a broadcaster, and serves on numerous charitable boards. He lives with his wife, Janine, in Michigan.Anticipating his own death, Albom&#39;s 82-year-old childhood rabbi asks him to write and deliver his eulogy. The request takes Albom back to his Jewish roots on a journey that contrasts differing faiths, ethnicities, races, and social classes. The book features a number of Albom&#39;s experiences--from his friendship with an African-American ex-convict, now an inner-city pastor, to his uncomfortable public discussions of faith with his rabbi. Albom is a rare author who reads his own work with skill. He delivers seamless narratives that capture subtle insights about his life&#39;s purpose, the need for forgiveness, his loss of faith, and his newfound belief in something larger than himself. Creating rich characterizations of his friends in both his writing and his narration, he explores his own preconceptions and misgivings, among other difficult issues, as he rediscovers the importance of faith.

Within its pages, Michael Gurian widely credited as the founder of today's "boys movement" takes readers through a complete parenting program, showing how to instill virtues in boys at each stage of life.<br><br>For parents and teachers who fear that our child-rearing systems have lost much of their ethical underpinnings and that our boys are becoming emotionally closed-off, <b>The Good Son</b> serves as a welcome guidepost. It is one of today's premier books on parenting and male development.</p><p><b>Michael Gurian</b> is a psychotherapist and bestselling author whose books include <b>The Wonder of Boys</b> and <b>The Good Son</b>. His work reflects the diverse cultures (European, Asian, Middle Eastern, and American) in which he lived, worked, and studied. He has taught psychology, religion, mythology, and literature at three American universities and at Ankara University in Turkey. He lives with his wife and two children in Spokane, Washington.A practical guide for parents in raising sons to become compassionate and responsible men. In calling for a ``moral and ethical revival in the raising of boys,'' therapist Gurian, the author of two prior books about raising boys, speaks to the concern of many that our culture is failing to develop character in its young males. After examining the gender differences in male brains, hormones, and social acculturation that place them at greater risk than females, he argues that boys need more structure, discipline, guidance, and training than is commonly provided. He then spells out the details in a ``Good Son Parenting Plan.'' The plan addresses the values of decency, fairness, empathy, self-sacrifice, respect, loyalty, service, responsibility, honesty, and honor. Each chapter tackles a stage of life: the age of obedience, comprising infancy, the toddler years, ages five and six; the age of convention: ages seven and eight, preadolescence, and prepuberty; and the age of moral intuition: puberty, the middle teens, and preadulthood. Instructive stories from a variety of sources open and close each chapterfables and myths from India, Hawaii, and East Africa, as well as personal experiences of parents and teachers. In each chapter the author traces the intellectual, emotional, and moral development occurring in that stage, and considers issues most likely to arise. He includes practical advice on dozens of issues from bedtime, television, and bullying to peer pressures, sex, drugs, and alcohol. Two features especially helpful to parents are ``The Range of Normal'' and ``Rules to Live By,'' in which Gurian sums up what is to be expected in a boys life at each stage. Appendices provide not only reading lists for parents but a selection of age-appropriate books and movies for stimulating moral growth in boys. A well-planned program whose nonsectarian, nonpreachy approach makes it an appropriate guide for all parents concerned about the moral development of their sons. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The setting is a small lumber town in Upper Michigan, the stomping grounds of Paul Bunyan and the giants of Swedish, German, and Finnish lore. Young Celie and her husband, Joe Linsen, are the children of Scandinavian pioneers. Radios and flivvers have enlarged her world, and she longs to escape from an isolated place where wild violet fireweed grows to the edge of the woods.</p><p>Annick Smith is a freelance writer, editor, and filmmaker. Her story, "It's Come to This," appeared in <i>Best American Short Stories, 1992</i>. She was coeditor, with William Kittredge, of <i>The Last Best Place: A Montana Anthology</i>. Her film credits include <i>Heartland</i> (executive producer) and <i>A River Runs Through It</i> (coproducer).Getting out of one's too-confining hometown is the lifelong dream of more than a few, and so it is with Celie Henderson, the paler, Swedish version of Dreiser's Carrie Meeber in Walker's long out-of-print 1934 novel. Celie lives and works with her family in the Michigan mill town of Flat Point, but has dreams of brighter lights in Milwaukee and Detroit. Celie chooses mill worker Joe Linsen for her husband, breaking off a dubious courtship with Arthur Farley, a piano-playing, juke-joint aficionado brought in by his uncle to take over mill operations. She spends most of her time agonizing over her decision, prodding Joe to look for a job in the city, fretting over the hard life and harsh winters in Flat Point. Ultimately, Celie must decide between the simple pleasures of her two children and sturdy Joe, and her yearnings for the city and finer things. Walker's novel is a thrilling dime-store page-turner, filled with sharply drawn characters and details--Celie is often seen in a bright green Sears catalogue dress and opera pumps, even in the snow. Only when Walker stretches toward the metaphorical does her novel falter. When ice blocks the road out of town, Celie becomes hysterical: " 'Joe, it's like you said, look; we couldn't get out if we wanted to.' Celie laughed a thin, harsh laugh that ended in a dry sob." Still, watching the couple as they grow, have children and come to accept each other will send the reader rocketing from front cover to back. Illustrations.

And conspicuous throughout is McInerney&#x2019;s trademark flair and expertise, which in 2006 prompted the James Beard Foundation to grant him the MFK Fisher Distinguished Writing Award.</p></p><p><p>Jay McInerney lives in Manhattan and Bridgehampton, New York. He writes a wine column for <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> and is a regular contributor to <i>The Guardian</i> and <i>Corriere della Sera</i>, and his fiction has appeared in <i>The New Yorker, Esquire, Playboy, Granta, </i>and<i> The Paris Review</i>.&nbsp; In 2006, <i>Time</i> cited <i>Bright Lights, Big City</i> as one of nine generation-defining novels of the twentieth century, and <i>The Good Life</i> received the Prix Littï¿½raire at the Deauville Film Festival in 2007. <i>How It Ended:&nbsp; New and Collected Stories</i> (2009) &#x201c;reminds us,&#x201d; Sam Tanenhaus wrote in <i>The New York Times Book Review,</i> &#x201c;how impressively broad McInerney's scope has been and how confidently he has ranged across wide swaths of our national experience.&#x201d;</p>Introduction<br><br>It all began with Hemingway, as so many things do. Specifically with <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>, or, as the Brits call it, <i>Fiesta</i>. The latter title being apposite, because part of what I carried away from that book in my youth was the sense that drinking wine was cool and sophisticated. And let&#x2019;s face it, this is one of the reasons we read books, especially in our youth, particularly books by Hemingway and Kerouac and Lawrence Durrell: to find out how to live and how to pose and where to travel and what to eat and drink and smoke along the way. Everybody in Hemingway&#x2019;s first novel is drinking wine. Not long after my vicarious adventures in Pam- plona, this sense of wine as an appurtenance of the well-lived life was reinforced by Evelyn Waugh&#x2019;s <i>Brideshead Revisited</i>, with Charles Ryder and Sebastian Flyte picturesquely draining the cel- lar at that estate over the course of a summer. I was so fixated on the wine and the scenery that I don&#x2019;t think I bothered to grasp the nature of their friendship. Not very Hemingwayesque, but again, for some reason I remember the wine . . .<br><br>The fact that wine had no place on my parents&#x2019; suburban dining table seemed to confirm its consumption as a mark of sophistication. They and their friends drank cocktails&#x2014;martinis, Manhattans, old-fashioneds, and stingers. And when they drank enough of them, they behaved badly, especially when they were in their stingers period, though this didn&#x2019;t strike me as romantic or chic. Much later I realized they were acting like the people in John Cheever&#x2019;s stories, once I finally got around to reading them; in fact it took me years to appreciate his writing, in part because his characters resembled my parents and their friends.<br><br>Hemingway was a great fan of Spanish<i> rosado</i>, which might be why, on my very first date, at the age of sixteen, I ordered a bottle of Mateus rose&#x301;, the spritzy Portuguese pink that came in a Buddha-shaped bottle. Never have I felt quite so worldly as I did that night at the Log Cabin Restaurant in Lenox, Massachusetts, as I sniffed the cork and nodded to the waiter. Many of my college romances were initiated over a bottle of Cha&#x302;teauneuf-du-Pape, the only red wine whose name I could remember, but while lurching toward adulthood, I preferred quicker fixes, partly in the semicon- scious belief, suggested by so much of my reading, that the road of excess would lead to the palace of wisdom, that the pursuit of an artistic career as a writer required a strictly Dionysian regi- men. Manhattan in the early eighties was a congenial venue for this aesthetic program, especially if your role models included Baudelaire, Dylan Thomas, Keith Richards, and Tom Verlaine. I worked at menial editorial jobs and, briefly, as a fact-checker for <i>The New Yorker</i> as I did my best to infiltrate the downtown night- club scene, which I imagined to be the contemporary equivalent of Isherwood&#x2019;s Berlin or Lautrec&#x2019;s Montmartre.<br><br>Not long after I was fired by <i>The New Yorker</i>, I was awakened at the crack of 2:00 p.m. by a call from my best friend, who informed me that Raymond Carver was en route to my apartment. You could have knocked me over with a rolled-up twenty-dollar bill, several of which were lying on my bedside table. <i>Jesus Christ!</i> Raymond Carver on my doorstep? Granted, there was some context here: my best friend, Gary Fisketjon, a junior editor at Random House, had reviewed a chapbook by Carver fo<i>r The Village Voice</i> and, through his legendary champion Gordon Lish, had gotten to know him. (He would later become Carver&#x2019;s editor, as well as my own.) Some years before, when we were at Williams College, I lent Gary a book called <i>Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?</i>, and since then we&#x2019;d both been passionate Carver fans. Now Gary was returning the favor with interest. They&#x2019;d had lunch together, and Carver had nothing to do until his reading at Columbia that evening, so Gary volunteered my services as a tour guide for the afternoon, assuming that I would be thrilled. Which I was, despite an apocalyptic headache. The buzzer rang, an indistinct mumble came through the intercom&#x2014;and then the doorway was filled by this hulking, slouching bear whom I ushered in to a tiny Greenwich Village apartment that showed all the signs of an arduous, recently terminated binge. We never got around to touring the city and instead talked for four or five hours, mostly about writing, until it was well past time to get Carver to his reading. At some point he said, almost apologetically, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, the life you&#x2019;re living here doesn&#x2019;t seem exactly conducive to writing.&#x201d; While it didn&#x2019;t take a master storyteller to make this observation, from him it sounded like an epiphany. Carver knew whereof he spoke, a devotee of Alcoholics Anonymous who credited that organization with saving his life. Six months later I moved to Syracuse to study with Ray and clean up my act.<br><br>Having heard nutritionists distinguish between good fats and bad fats, I would propose a similar dichotomy for intoxicants. Certainly this was the opinion of Thomas Jefferson, the nation&#x2019;s first wine geek. &#x201c;No nation is drunken where wine is cheap,&#x201d; he declared, &#x201c;and none sober where the dearness of wine substitutes ardent spirits as the common beverage. It is, in truth, the only antidote to the bane of whiskey.&#x201d; Or vodka, I might add. One can&#x2019;t help but wonder how different Russia&#x2019;s history might have been if the country was warm enough for viticulture. &#x201c;Wine is one of the most civilized things in the world,&#x201d; Hemingway wrote in <i>Death in the Afternoon</i>, &#x201c;and one of the natural things of the world that has been brought to the greatest perfection, and it offers a greater range for enjoyment and appreciation than, possibly, any other purely sensory thing.&#x201d; Not his greatest prose, perhaps, and like so many encomiums to wine&#x2014;the earnest Jefferson&#x2019;s springs to mind&#x2014;it leaves out the buzz factor. (They don&#x2019;t, for example, call them winos for nothing.)Still, it impressed me at the time, especially since I&#x2019;d discovered that the bane of whiskey and the road of excess hadn&#x2019;t led me to any palaces at all.<br><br>But Syracuse was leading me in far more rewarding directions, in large part thanks to Ray and Tobias Wolff demonstrating how to advance from apprenticeship into actual <i>writing</i>. To supplement my fellowship&#x2014;tuition plus four grand a year&#x2014;I worked as a clerk in the Westcott Cordial Shop, whose Princeton-educated proprietor had an extensive wine library and high hopes for the scabrous neighborhood&#x2019;s eventual gentrification. Here I could oscillate between the stories of Isaac Babel and Hugh Johnson&#x2019;s <i>World Atlas of Wine</i>, dip into the stock after finishing my shift, and gradually refine my rudimentary palate.<br><br>This is also where I got the call, some two years on, that my novel had been bought by Random House, and a subsequent one from a guy who kept calling me &#x201c;babe&#x201d; and wanted to fly me out to Hollywood to meet with his fellow executives at Paramount. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll put you up at the Chateau Marmont,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Is that good?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s better than good,&#x201d; he assured me. &#x201c;John Belushi died there.&#x201d; Clearly he&#x2019;d read Bright Lights, Big City, or at least the cov- erage of the book, and formed an opinion of my bad habits.<br><br>A decade later, I was able to merge these double-barreled habits of wine and writing. My friend Dominique Browning, in charge of resurrecting Conde&#x301; Nast&#x2019;s <i>House &amp; Garden</i>, knew of my devel- oping vinous passion, invited me to do a monthly column, and proceeded to send me pretty much any place in the world where I thought there was a good wine story&#x2014;a master-class education I am profoundly grateful for, and one that would be hard to imagine in this era of editorial budget slashing and what&#x2019;s beginning to look like the mass extinction of general-interest publications. Indeed, somewhat ahead of the curve, <i>House &amp; Garden</i> was shut down in 2007. Sad as I was about its demise and my friend&#x2019;s misfortune, I reasoned that it had been a hell of a good run. I&#x2019;d never intended to write about wine for more than a year or two, and it was time to turn all my energies back to fiction. And so I did until, a couple of years later, <i>The Wall Street Journal </i>came calling. A few of the following essays, much revised here, date back to Dominique&#x2019;s magazine, and most from my current gig. One of them, a review of Robert Mondavi&#x2019;s autobiography published in <i>The New Yorker</i>, seemed very much worth reprinting here in the wake of his passing. The world of wine would likely look&#x2014;and taste&#x2014;very different if not for Mondavi, whom I was fortunate enough to spend time with on several occasions.<br>Heraclitus tells us you can never step into the same river twice, &#x201c;for other waters are ever flowing on to you.&#x201d; And likewise, it seems to me, you can never really drink the same wine twice. The appreciation of wine, for all that we might try to quantify it, is in the end a subjective experience. More than a poem or a painting or a concerto, which is problematic enough for the aesthetician, the 1982 La Mission, say, or the 1999 Beaucastel is a moving target. Good wine continues to grow and develop in the glass and in the bottle, to change from one day to the next in response to baro- metric pressures and other variables; moreover, any given wine&#x2014; from the same maker, the same vintage, even the same barrel&#x2014;is subject to our own quirks of receptivity, to the place and the com- pany in which we drink it, to the knowledge we bring with us, and to the food with which we pair it. Even so, in order to develop our appreciation, we agree to a fictional objectivity and attempt to iso- late wine from these contextual variables, to treat each and every glass in front of us as if it contained a stable and quantifiable sub- stance. We Americans are often scolded for adhering to this view, and one critic in particular has been accused of reducing wine&#x2019;s infinite variety and complexity to a vulgar game of numbers. On the other hand, the felon in question, Robert Parker, has helped to democratize and demystify something that until very recently was stuffy, arcane, and elitist. His core belief&#x2014;that wine can be evaluated and graded like any other consumer product&#x2014;was hugely liberating for those of us on both sides of the Atlantic who wanted to penetrate the mysteries of the great French growths. And it took this middle-class lawyer, who&#x2019;d grown up drinking <i>soft drinks </i>with meals, to begin to clear away the musty, upper-class stench of oenophilia.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve learned quite a bit in the last fifteen years, and my tastes have shifted accordingly (if sometimes mystifyingly). Burgundy has become something of an obsession, and there are more than a few essays&#x2014;an entire section, actually&#x2014;devoted to the fickle, intermittently exhilarating, and heartbreaking wines of that region. But I still love Bordeaux, not only the famous wines, but also the Crus Bourgeois from relatively obscure corners like Fronsac and Lalande-de-Pomerol, which represent tremendous value in the face of the madly escalating prices of the classed growths from the 2009 and 2010 vintages. Just when I think my interest in California is flagging, I taste a new wine like Steve Matthiasson&#x2019;s white blend or an old one like Araujo&#x2019;s 1995 Eisele Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon and get excited all over again. Italy now accounts for about a third of American wine imports and for me remains a continuing source of wonder and pleasure. Spain might well be the new Italy, a country with a long history of wine making that&#x2019;s finally waking up to its potential. Something similar is happening in South Africa, which has a wine-making tradition extending back to the seventeenth century. Some of the wines I write about here are costly and hard to find, but I believe it&#x2019;s one of the wine writer&#x2019;s duties, however arduous it might sound, to bring back news of the best and the rarest, just as it&#x2019;s the travel writer&#x2019;s duty to explore exotic and remote destina- tions. Most readers of automotive magazines won&#x2019;t ever drive a Lamborghini or a Ferrari, and most wine drinkers will never hold a glass of Cha&#x302;teau Latour, but as an avid reader of <i>Car and Driver</i> I&#x2019;d hate to see it limit its coverage to sensible, affordable rides. No, I want a knowledgeable, badass driver to tell me what it&#x2019;s like to power the new Gallardo Superleggera through the Alps. So, yes, there&#x2019;s some wine porn here. That said, some of the most surpris- ing and exciting moments involve obscure and undervalued wines like the 2007 Movia Pinot Grigio from Slovenia or overachievers like the 2007 Cha&#x302;teau Jean Faux Bordeaux, which at $25 retail is $1,200 cheaper than the 2010 Latour.<br><br>Much as I have ostensibly learned since I started writing about wine, and as lucky as I have been to have tasted some of the renowned vintages, I&#x2019;m not sure that I&#x2019;ve ever enjoyed a bot- tle of wine more than I did that Mateus rose&#x301; back in the Berk- shires in 1972. I&#x2019;d lately acquired my driver&#x2019;s license and was in the company of my first love, with the night and the entire sum- mer stretched out ahead of me like a river full of fat, silvery, pink- fleshed rainbow trout. The wine tasted like summer, and it was about to become the taste of my first real kiss.</p><h2>The American wilderness: Essays</h2><p>Used. Very Good conditions.

It is one of the greatest religious poems in English literature, the work of a nameless poet of superb genius. Immediately attractive, its poetic content is readily accessible to the modern reader, being in the mainstream of Western religious thought. Representative of the Golden Age of Anglo-Saxon culture, drawing on both visual and doctrinal motifs, it provides a ready introduction to its own intellectual and artistic milieu. This is underlined by intimate links with the Ruthwell Cross, the documentary context of the earlier version, and itself often regarded as one of the finest monuments of the Anglo-Saxon Age. This edition presents a conservative text with variant readings described in the notes.

AH, I SEE I HAVE ALARMED YOU. DO NOT BE FRIGHTENED BY MY BEARD. I AM A LOVER OF AMERICA...&#39; So speaks the mysterious stranger at a Lahore cafe as dusk settles. Invited to join him for tea, you learn his name and what led this speakerr of immaculate English to seek you out. For he is more worldly than you might expect; better travelled and better educated. He knows the West better than you do. And as he tells you his story, of how he embraced the Western dream-and a Western woman-and how both betrayed him, so the night darkens. Then the true reason for your meeting becomes abundantly clear...</p><p>Mohsin Hamid's first novel, <i>Moth Smoke</i>, dealt with the confluence of personal and political themes, and his second, <i>The Reluctant Fundamentalist</i>, revisits that territory in the person of Changez, a young Pakistani. Told in a single monologue, the narrative never flags. Changez is by turns naive, sinister, unctuous, mildly threatening, overbearing, insulting, angry, resentful, and sad. He tells his story to a nameless, mysterious American who sits across from him at a Lahore cafe. Educated at Princeton, employed by a first-rate valuation firm, Changez was living the American dream, earning more money than he thought possible, caught up in the New York social scene and in love with a beautiful, wealthy, damaged girl. The romance is negligible; Erica is emotionally unavailable, endlessly grieving the death of her lifelong friend and boyfriend, Chris. <p> Changez is in Manila on 9/11 and sees the towers come down on TV. He tells the American, "...I <i>smiled</i>. Yes, despicable as it may sound, my initial reaction was to be remarkably pleased... I was caught up in the symbolism of it all, the fact that someone had so visibly brought America to her knees..." When he returns to New York, there is a palpable change in attitudes toward him, starting right at immigration. His name and his face render him suspect. </p><p> Ongoing trouble between Pakistan and India urge Changez to return home for a visit, despite his parents' advice to stay where he is. While there, he realizes that he has changed in a way that shames him. "I was struck at first by how shabby our house appeared... I was saddened to find it in such a state... This was where I came from... and it smacked of lowliness." He exorcises that feeling and once again appreciates his home for its "unmistakable personality and idiosyncratic charm." While at home, he lets his beard grow. Advised to shave it, even by his mother, he refuses. It will be his line in the sand, his statement about who he is. His company sends him to Chile for another business valuation; his mind filled with the troubles in Pakistan and the U.S. involvement with India that keeps the pressure on. His work and the money he earns have been overtaken by resentment of the United States and all it stands for. </p><p> Hamid's prose is filled with insight, subtly delivered: "I felt my age: an almost childlike twenty-two, rather than that permanent middle-age that attaches itself to the man who lives alone and supports himself by wearing a suit in a city not of his birth." In telling of the janissaries, Christian boys captured by Ottomans and trained to be soldiers in the Muslim Army, his Chilean host tells him: "The janissaries were always taken in childhood. It would have been far more difficult to devote themselves to their adopted empire, you see, if they had memories they could not forget." Changez cannot forget, and Hamid makes the reader understand that--and all that follows. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i> </p><p> </p> <br><b>A Conversation with Mohsin Hamid </b><br>Set in modern-day Pakistan, Mohsin Hamid's debut novel, <i>Moth Smoke</i>, went on to win awards and was listed as a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book of the Year.

It's going to be a long, hard day. The blistering heat rises from the desert, eventually reaching 110 degrees by midday. The crew is scheduled to drop off twenty-four electronic slot machines, each costing $15,000, weighing six hundred pounds, and featuring stars like Pat Sajak whooping and hollering on the sound track. Lots of bells and sirens for the fanny-pack and flip-flop crowd. &nbsp; <br><br>At 9:54 the eighteen-wheeler pulls up to the south side of the hotel, next to the Desert Inn Race &amp; Sports Book. &nbsp; <br><br>After manhandling five of the machines onto a forklift, Pedro wipes the sweat from his brow and glances toward the Sports entrance as an off-duty showgirl pedals by on her red bicycle. Beyond the casino doors is a strip of landscaping about thirty feet long and twenty feet wide; there, something catches Pedro's eye. On a morning devoid of breeze, it seems odd that the rosemary plants in the mini-oasis appear to be moving. Pedro looks again. The thick shrubbery shakes vigorously and then, to Pedro's amazement, expels two dark shapes. Pedro blinks. "What the fuck?" &nbsp; <br><br>As a second, smaller truck-gray and boxlike, with blue striping on its side-turns off Spring Mountain Avenue and approaches the casino entrance, the shapes from the shrubbery come into focus: two men dressed in black from head to toe. They are moving, all too quickly, toward Pedro and the eighteen-wheeler. They are armed. &nbsp; <br><br>Pedro Sandoval, a former paratrooper, recognizes the firearms and issues new orders to his three-man slot machine crew, perhaps the most prudent and useful instructions he has given in his twelve years as a foreman. "Fuck the slots!" he yells. "Vamonos, vamonos, muchachos! Vete de aquï¿½! Get out of here!" &nbsp; <br><br>The movers break and run in the direction of Las Vegas Boulevard. &nbsp; <br><br>The gunmen are now within thirty yards of the moving van, but they have no interest in the slot machines or the laborers fleeing the scene. The men in black have been hiding in the bushes since four in the morning, sleeping, fidgeting, quarreling, dreaming of untold riches and pristine beaches in Costa Rica, beautiful women in Spain, oceanfront villas in Portugal, and leggy, bronze women in Rio. Although the desert night is balmy and the early morning uncomfortably warm, the two men wear black fatigue trousers, black boots, black sweatshirts, black hoods, black baseball batting gloves, and black ski masks. The shorter man clutches a white garbage bag. His taller, heavier partner carries a duffle bag containing hand grenades and spare ammunition magazines that rattle. The larger man has a .45-caliber Glock pistol in his right hand. &nbsp; <br><br>The squat gray truck that just pulled off Spring Mountain Avenue and rolled to a stop in front of the Desert Inn is the target of the gunmen. Often called an armored car, the vehicle is a 25,500-pound 1994 International Harvester 300 truck with 10-gauge galvanneal zinc-alloy steel plating, level-three window armor capable of stopping a .44 Magnum, five gun ports, and high-security six-pin key-lock cylinders. There is an emblem on the truck and the word BRINK'S spelled out in large blue letters. Inside are a driver and two guards. Each carries a .38-caliber pistol in a holster. &nbsp; <br><br>The Brink's truck, on the road since six in the morning, began the day at the Sahara Hotel and Casino, then picked up cash at hotels along the southern end of the Strip, including Circus Circus, Westward Ho, the Stardust, Treasure Island, the Mirage, Caesars Palace, Harrah's, and the Venetian. The Desert Inn will be the last stop before the armored car heads for the suburbs to make additional pickups at shopping centers. &nbsp; <br><br>The gunmen close in. &nbsp; <br><br>Pay attention to the shorter man. There is something different about him. He walks like a prizefighter on his way to the ring, witnesses will later recall. He dances, he bobs, he weaves, he's ready for action, he's ready to do damage, but now he is telling us to pay attention. Look at me, he is saying. Look at how nimble I am, how strong and swift and sure. I am the leader. Look at me and do as I say. &nbsp; <br><br>The second gunman, taller and heavier, is described by eyewitnesses as "lumbering," most likely because of the obvious body armor he wears and the spare ammunition and duffel bag he carries. &nbsp; <br><br>Now the shorter man reaches into the garbage bag and pulls out a compact black weapon with a long banana clip that curls forward. When compared to a hunter's .30-30 or a U.S. Army M16, it is stubby and compact. The gun has no wooden stock, a large front sight, and a prominent flash suppressor. Thanks to the hurried, energetic way the gunman approaches the truck, he almost seems like a casino host greeting an important arrival. &nbsp; <br><br>The Brink's truck is now stopped in front of the Desert Inn's south casino entrance facing Las Vegas Boulevard and the Frontier Hotel and Casino. The engine rumbles. Two thirty-six-inch-wide side doors, with continuous stainless-steel hinges, shock-absorbing nylon-web straps, and nonslip internal steps, swing open. &nbsp; <br><br>Chuck Fichter is the designated guard on this run. Randy Easton is the driver, and Donald Bowman will handle the money-the messenger, in Brink's terminology. Sometimes Fichter drives the truck, but today Chuck will exit the vehicle first, move into a prearranged position by the casino doors, and cover the messenger, who physically transports the money into the casino on a two-wheel metal dolly known as the money cart. At five foot eight, 180 pounds, Fichter is stocky, square jawed, gray haired, and athletic, and although he is fifty-six, he could pass for a man in his mid-forties. Despite degrees from Indiana University and Northern Arizona University, and dual careers as a high-school social studies teacher and a tennis instructor, Fichter considers himself adrift in life. A self-described hedonist, he came to Las Vegas in 1989. But now Fichter has become a drinker, a gambler, a man attracted to any female with a discernible pulse. Fichter admits he is out of control. He was once a devout Catholic, an altar boy at St. Ann's church back home in Dixon, Illinois. For two years, Fichter worked as a casino supervisor in a sports betting operation, but he grew tired of rousting angry drunks and took the Brink's job, he says, because it requires absolutely no intellect. He has never fired a gun in anger and, unlike many Brink's guards, has no military or law enforcement background. He earns $9.50 an hour. &nbsp; <br><br>Fichter's partner is forty-nine-year-old Donald Bowman. Other Brink's employees marvel that Fichter and Bowman are close friends. Fichter is intense and educated, a talker and a cynic, while Bowman is easygoing, a listener, a man who takes life as it comes. At six foot one and 205 pounds, Bowman has rough, calloused hands from a career in construction. He's also an ex-marine, having spent two tours in Vietnam as an ammunition handler. As a rifleman, Bowman qualified as a crack shot. Bowman tells Fichter that he was in Vietnam for two Christmases, '67 and '68, and his claim to fame was "seeing Bob Hope twice. The second time, he brought Ann-Margret." &nbsp; <br><br>Today the two men, between stops on the Strip before they reach the Desert Inn, talk about the amount of cash aboard the truck. They've never seen the truck so filled with money bags, and Fichter is concerned. There are so many stops and pickups now, so much cash to haul back and forth to the casinos-doesn't anybody ever win in this town? &nbsp; <br><br>Bowman grins, but Fichter is not necessarily joking. The local Brink's manager is bucking for a promotion, and the truck guys get the short end of the stick, Fichter says. He feels the manager is overloading the trucks with too much cash. The two men have picked up so much money today that the cash is stuffed in what the guards call body bags-sacks that when filled come up to the courier's waist. &nbsp; <br><br>"People think this is easy work, but it's not," Fichter says as the armored vehicle approaches the Desert Inn. "In and out of the trucks, up and down the ramps, working your way through the crowded casinos, pulling heavy loads on carts-this is hard work. If anything goes wrong, God forbid, it's never Brink's' fault." &nbsp; <br><br>Bowman smiles broadly. He's heard this before. &nbsp; <br><br>"The Brink's mentality is, if there's a robbery, it must be an inside job," Fichter continues. "The driver didn't do the right thing. The messenger didn't do the right thing. <br><br>The guard didn't do the right thing." &nbsp; The truck turns off Las Vegas Boulevard and enters the south Desert Inn parking lot.

And when it does, these delicate, injury prone beasts need swift treatment. Otherwise, a simple eating disorder might rapidly lead to death and a minor hoof injury to permanent lameness. To make things even more difficult, equine veterinary care is costly and insurance prohibitively expensive. That&#x2019;s why any horse owner, as well as equine veterinarians and students of veterinary medicine, must have this ultimate resource on hand.<br><i>The Comprehensive Guide to Equine Veterinary Medicine</i> is a thorough, carefully designed medical reference featuring four-color anatomical drawings by the most acclaimed veterinary illustrator Kip Carter. It covers all areas of equine health, including diagnosis and treatment, and delves into basic equine behavior and safety, preventive health care, and first aid. Twelve in-depth chapters outline the individual body systems, anatomy and physiology, and abnormalities. A Health Care section includes alternative therapies such as acupuncture and homeopathy, along with options for rehabilitation and physical therapy. Critical information appears in tables, charts, side bars, and bulleted lists for quick access.<br>In addition, there&#x2019;s an informative history of veterinary procedures, followed by three valuable appendices with terminology, common medications, and advice for the first-time horse owner.<br><i>A selection of the Equestrian Book Club.</i></p><p></p><h2>The Wisdom of Birds: An Illustrated History of Ornithology</h2><p><p>For thousands of years people have been fascinated by birds, and today that fascination is still growing.

Singer continues his "blistering indictment of so-called humane use of animals in scientific research" ( LJ 12/1/75), describes the current (and still atrocious) state of animal testing, and brings up to date the activities of the animal rights movement, nascent at the time of the first edition's release.

After five years of rejection and one complete revision, Heller's first book,&nbsp;<i>Chickens Aren't the Only Ones</i>, about egg-laying animals, was published in 1981. It was so successful that the sequel, and second book to be published,&nbsp;<i>Animals Born Alive And Well</i>&nbsp;(1982), about mammals, quickly followed. In 1983 and 1984, her third and fourth titles,&nbsp;<i>The Reason For A Flower</i>&nbsp;(about plants that have seeds and flowers) and&nbsp;<i>Plants That Never Ever Bloom</i>&nbsp;(about plants that do not) were published.<br> <br> She then began work on a collection of six books, the&nbsp;<i>How To Hide</i>&nbsp;series on camouflage and the magic of this phenomenon in nature, which covered the entire animal kingdom -- insects, birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and sea creatures. The next collection of books became a five-volume series on parts of speech:&nbsp;<i>A Cache of Jewels and Other Collective Nouns; Kites Sail High: A Book About Verbs; Many Luscious Lollipops: A Book About Adjectives; Merry-Go-Round: A Book About Nouns;</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Up, Up and Away: A Book About Adverbs</i>. She also wrote and illustrated the unique and fascinating book&nbsp;<i>Color</i>, a charming and instructive guide to how art goes through the four color printing process.<br> <br> Among the notable people who have had an influence on Heller's writing have been: Ogden Nash, Gilbert and Sullivan, Edward Lear, Hilaire Belloc, and Dr. Seuss. Heller says of her work, "All my books are nonfiction picture books in rhyme. I find writing in rhyme enjoyable and challenging, and I think it is an easy way for children to learn new facts and acquire a sophisticated vocabulary. Children are not intimidated by big words. I try to make my writing succinct and allow the illustrations to convey as much information as possible."In this latest addition to Heller's expanding collection of parts-of-speech books, the author/artist employs her characteristically vibrant, larger-than-life paintings to examine the many aspects of adverbs. Readers are told--and captivatingly shown--that "ADVERBS work terrifically when answering specifically . . . 'How?' 'How often?' 'When?' and 'Where?' " A glorious blue-and-white Victorian house, for example, drips gingerbread trim across one spread: it was painted "RECENTLY." The question, "WHY do pandas eat bamboo?" is posed against a comparatively spare spread of three beguiling creatures devouring green leaves. If this book is a bit more confusing than the earlier volumes, it is chiefly because of the inherent diversity of the topic--young grammarians may well be puzzled that the words in a bride's vow of "YES, INDEED, FOREVER" are equated with the "how" of "HOW do you do?" Nevertheless, Heller once again offers an informative English lesson that is great fun to read and rife with theatrics.

In this first single-authored history of Virginia since the 1970s, Peter Wallenstein traces major themes across four centuries in a brisk narrative that recalls the people and events that have shaped the Old Dominion.<br><br>Historical accounts of Virginia have often emphasized harmony and tradition, but Wallenstein focuses on the impact of conflict and change. From the beginning, Virginians have debated and challenged each other's visions of Virginia, and Wallenstein shows how these differences have influenced its sometimes turbulent development. Casting an eye on blacks as well as whites, and on people from both east and west of the Blue Ridge Mountains, he traces such key themes as political power, racial identity, and education.<br><br>Bringing to bear his long experience teaching Virginia history, Wallenstein takes readers back, even before Jamestown, to the Elizabethan settlers at Roanoke Island and the inhabitants they encountered, as well as to Virginia's leaders of the American Revolution. He chronicles the state's dramatic journey through the Civil War era, a time that revealed how the nation's evolution sometimes took shape in opposition to the vision of many leading Virginians. He also examines the impact of the civil rights movement and considers controversies that accompany Virginia into its fifth century.<br><br>The text is copiously illustrated to depict not only such iconic figures as Pocahontas, George Washington, and Robert E. Lee, but also such other prominent native Virginians as Edgar Allan Poe, Carter G. Woodson, and Patsy Cline. Sidebars throughout the book offer further insight, while maps and appendixes of reference data make the volume a complete resource on Virginia's history.<br><br>As people in Virginia and elsewhere prepare to observe the 400th anniversary of Jamestown's settlement, Wallenstein's fresh interpretation marks a significant commemoration of that beginning of Virginia&#x2014;and America&#x2014;and shows us that the adventure of Virginia has in many ways been the adventure of America.</p><p>"From Pocahontas to Patsy Cline, from William Byrd I to Harry Byrd, Jr., <i>Cradle of America</i> brings to life four hundred years of Virginia history.

While perhaps most famous for its architecture and furniture, garden design was fully encompassed within the Movement and Gertrude Jekyll, Edwin Lutyens, Inigo Triggs and Samuel Elgood were very influential figures. This exploration of the principles of the Arts and Crafts garden explains the inspiration applied from Stuart garden and cottage garden design, the wild gardens with winding paths, the precisely clipped hedges, the formal terraces and the billowing border plantings of bulbs, herbs and climbers. From the most formally clipped topiary to the most informal-looking wild borders, everything was carefully designed, and most often accentuated by gazebos, gateways, sundials, topiary and ponds. This beautifully illustrated book throws open the gates to the Arts and Crafts Garden and gives an extensive list of the best examples of these gardens in the UK.</p><p><b>Sarah Rutherford</b>&nbsp;is an expert&nbsp;in the conservation of historic parks and gardens.

It was not often lavishly used in Arts and Crafts gardens, and was usually restricted to one or two key pieces placed at focal points around the house; larger collections could be spread throughout the garden. The extent of the use of sculpture was usually dependent upon the wealth of the owner. Traditional figures and decorative subjects were mostly favored. Urns were common; also fountains and particularly masks. Lead was popular as a traditional material that withstood the British climate well, making it suitable for ornamented water features and troughs, and it showcased British craftsmanship. Stone and composite stone pieces, offered by firms such as James Pulham &amp; Son, were also popular.<br>Pots and tubs were carefully placed in singles and groups around the house and on terraces.

It is part of its very<br>essence. Simplicity is closely aligned with truth, for it allows us to<br>deal directly with the ordinariness of daily events and see them in their<br>true reality. Simplicity embraces truth and tries to escape as far as<br>possible from falsehood, complexity, multiplicity, tensions, conflict,<br>division, and all that ultimately leads to destruction.<br><br>The original Greek word for monk is monachos, which means the man that is<br>alone, one in himself, single-minded, simple. In entering monastic life,<br>the monk deliberately embraces the way of simplicity and promises to seek<br>God throughout his life in true simplicity of heart. His monastic journey,<br>therefore, consists essentially of a constant effort to attain this<br>perfect simplicity by letting go of the clutter and accumulations of the<br>past and by opening himself intimately and solely to the reality of the<br>present moment. In connecting with the present moment, the monk discovers<br>within himself the inner harmony of true simplicity, for it is in this<br>transparent simplicity of the present moment that he encounters the living<br>God.<br><br>Authentic simplicity, as commanded and inspired by the Gospel, demands<br>asceticism and spiritual effort on the part of every Christian and hence<br>of the monk. It demands the practice of self-renunciation and the letting<br>go of all forms of worldly illusion. Practiced this way, monastic<br>simplicity becomes the antithesis to the falsehood of the ways of the<br>world. While the wisdom of the world stresses the glorification and<br>exaltation of the self, monastic simplicity finds its purpose in the<br>practice of humility and frugality that frees the human heart for the love<br>of God and His Kingdom.<br><br>It is of the very essence of monastic simplicity that the inner spiritual<br>life and the practical ordinary tasks of daily life be woven by the same<br>thread. Since it is the same faith that inspires every moment and every<br>act of the monastic existence, a dichotomy between what is purely<br>spiritual and what is more secular or mundane in character would be<br>considered artificial and totally incompatible in monastic life. People<br>who visit monasteries are sometimes surprised seeing the monks or nuns<br>occupied with such trivia as milking cows, feeding the chickens, weeding<br>the gardens, scrubbing the floors, baking the daily bread, and so on. They<br>imagine them always at prayers in the church, singing chants or reading in<br>the library or in the solitude of their cells. They are astonished to<br>discover that for these monks and nuns, prayer and work do not conflict<br>with each other. Instead, they are simply two distinct parcels of the same<br>entity. Slowly visitors begin to realize that the simplicity and unity of<br>monastic life is woven throughout all of that life&#x2019;s events, whether they<br>be liturgical or private prayer, manual or intellectual work, spiritual<br>reading or chanting, practicing hospitality or living in the strictest of<br>solitudes, shearing sheep or cooking in the kitchen. What may seem an<br>apparent conflict to the secular eye, it is a source of unity to the monk.<br>The monk&#x2019;s sole concern remains that &#x201c;God be glorified in all things,&#x201d; as<br>counseled by Saint Benedict.<br><br>The daily rhythm of monastic life attaches great importance to the time<br>spent in the kitchen and food preparation, to time in the refectory and<br>the act of consuming food. Saint Benedict attached great importance to<br>these matters, and throughout the whole of monastic tradition, food<br>retained a sacred character, because of the importance given to it by<br>Christ Himself. Anyone participating today in the life of a monastery<br>notices the importance the monks and nuns give to their meals, their<br>practical and healthy method of cooking, and their reverential way of<br>serving food at the table and their equally reverent consumption of it.<br>The meal, depending on the season of the year (fasting or nonfasting), day<br>of the week, or celebration, may consist of several courses, prepared and<br>served in great simplicity, but always enhanced by a tradition of good<br>taste cultivated in monasteries throughout the centuries.<br><br>Across the ages monastic cooking, both in the Christian and non-Christian<br>tradition (Buddhist, Hindu, and so on) has distinguished itself from other<br>forms of cooking, for their simplicity, frugality, balance, wholesomeness,<br>and flavor. Monastic cooking entails much more than the just plain<br>preparation of ordinary good food. For instance, the monastery cook works<br>in collaboration with the monks in charge of the kitchen gardens, and he<br>relies on their help in order to assure the quality and freshness of the<br>produce presented at the table. The same close collaboration takes place<br>between him and the monk&#x2019;s farmer, who helps provide the eggs, the milk,<br>the butter, and the cheese consumed at the monastic table. At the<br>beginning of his formation the future monastic cook is apprenticed to an<br>older, more experienced monk cook. This is so that he may be properly<br>trained and learn from the wise experience of the elder. It usually takes<br>years of experience and much imagination before the new cook is able to<br>develop creative, delicious, and well-balanced meals on his own. To arrive<br>at this point, it takes a certain experience and also a creative<br>thriftiness, which indeed, is very monastic.<br><br>The recipes presented in this book reflect the experience of a simple<br>monastic cuisine, in particular, the cuisine at Our Lady of the<br>Resurrection. In my experience as a monk and cookbook author, I have at<br>times been criticized for the extreme bare simplicity of my recipes, but<br>more often have been congratulated for it. I do not know how many people<br>have told me again and again that they were afraid to engage themselves in<br>the art of cooking because of its apparent complexity and were greatly<br>helped by the rudimentariness of my recipes, which they said helped them<br>overcome their fears and gave them new confidence. In response, I always<br>encouraged these people to stick with the ways of simplicity in the<br>kitchen, for simplicity itself is synonymous with elegance and good taste.<br>Some of the most elegant, attractive, and appetizing dishes I have ever<br>eaten have been prepared in humble monastery kitchens or in plain country<br>farm kitchens, which sometimes lacked the latest, more expensive<br>technological tools used in modern kitchens. But the cooks in these<br>kitchens had something else going for them. They were creative, efficient,<br>and highly industrious about how they prepared and arranged their dishes.<br>Moreover, they cooked with unaffected skill and great simplicity, with<br>great joy and loving care. The result was food of outstanding quality that<br>brought utter delight to the eye, to the palate, and to the soul.<br><br>In presenting these time-tested recipes to the public, my sincere hope is<br>that the reader who is eager to experiment in the kitchen will discover<br>the deep satisfaction inherent in preparing recipes that are guided by the<br>two important principles emphasized here: good quality and wholesome<br>simplicity. I encourage the cook to experiment, improve, and even make<br>certain changes, if necessary, but keep in mind never to sacrifice the<br>principles of quality and simplicity that are the guiding light of this<br>particular cuisine.<br><br>In completing this Introduction I wish to thank my editor at Doubleday,<br>Trace Murphy, who strongly supported me in the undertaking of this work. I<br>wish to thank also the many friends in France, Quebec, and here in the<br>U.S.A. who encouraged me and enlighten me along the way. I wish to thank<br>Brother Peter Michael Preble, Sister Ana M. Martinez, and her mother, all<br>of whom patiently typed these recipes. And last but not least, many thanks<br>to our dear friends John and Susan Conrad for typing the Introduction.<br><br>My ultimate wish and hope is that these recipes with the accompanying<br>quotations go a long way to inspire many to cook and to walk in the ways<br>of simplicity.<br>Brother Victor-Antoine, monk<br><br>September 14, 1999<br><br>Feast of the Holy and Glorious Cross of Christ<br>How to Use<br>This Cookbook<br>The preparation of a dinner, be it either the daily ordinary one or a<br>festal one for a special occasion, can demand a great deal of time and<br>energy. This is true in a home, in a monastery, or even for the person who<br>lives alone. It is indispensable, then, that the meals be well planned<br>ahead of time.<br><br>In planning a meal, one must first be guided by the two elementary<br>principles of quality and simplicity that I emphasized in the<br>Introduction. In addition, one must make sure that the meal is balanced,<br>tasty, nutritious, and certainly, economically reasonable. The use of<br>fresh seasonal ingredients is absolutely a must.<br><br>This book follows a different method of presenting the recipes from my<br>previous cookbooks, which tended to follow the seasonal or monthly<br>calendar.

Comfortable divots you could fill some day, if you wanted to. My mother sighs, my friends sigh. "You're so sad," they say. I'm not, I'm really not. I'm just trying to breathe fully.

In its place, they created one that empowered the modern citizen-consumer. This profound transformation was the uncoordinated and self-serving work of merchants, manufacturers, advertisers, auctioneers, politicians, and consumers themselves, who collectively created the nation's modern consumer economy: one that encouraged individuals to indulge their desires for the sake of the public good and cast the freedom to consume as a triumph of democracy. In <i>Luxurious Citizens</i>, Joanna Cohen traces the remarkable ways in which Americans tied consumer desire to the national interest between the end of the Revolution and the Civil War.</p><p>Illuminating the links between political culture, private wants, and imagined economies, Cohen offers a new understanding of the relationship between citizens and the nation-state in nineteenth-century America. By charting the contest over economic rights and obligations in the United States, <i>Luxurious Citizens</i> argues that while many less powerful Americans helped to create the citizen-consumer it was during the Civil War that the Union government made use of this figure, by placing the responsibility for the nation's economic strength and stability on the shoulders of the people. Union victory thus enshrined a new civic duty in American life, one founded on the freedom to buy as you pleased. Reinterpreting the history of the tariff, slavery, and the coming of the Civil War through an examination of everyday acts of consumption and commerce, Cohen reveals the important ways in which nineteenth-century Americans transformed their individual desires for goods into an index of civic worth and fixed unbridled consumption at the heart of modern America's political economy.</p></p><p>Joanna Cohen teaches American history at Queen Mary University of London.<p>"With [her] marvelous new study, Joanna Cohen [has] demonstrated how the consumer has been a key category in American political culture since the late eighteenth century. . . . [This] highly original and beautifully written and researched book has expanded the vision of the consumer citizen . . . [and] effectively put to bed tired assumptions about the commercialization of politics and the apolitical nature of consumer culture in modern America."&#x2014;<i>Enterprise &amp; Society</i></p><br><br><p>"<i>Luxurious Citizens</i> challenges us to rethink the historical origins of the modern American consumer-citizen. A rich cultural and political history of economic ideas, no other book explains so well how the United States, a country born from a consumer boycott against British luxuries, became a nation in which consumer gratification was a fundamental entitlement of democratic citizenship. Deeply researched, gracefully written, incisively argued, <i>Luxurious Citizens</i> is no less timely."&#x2014;Jonathan Levy, University of Chicago</p><br><br><p>"<i>Luxurious Citizens</i> offers a bold new history of American civic culture between the Revolution and the Civil War. Skillfully moving between the learned treatises of political economists and the everyday desires of shoppers, Cohen rethinks enduring questions of capitalism, citizenship, and governance through the crucial lens of consumerism."&#x2014;Seth Rockman, Brown University</p><br><br><p>"Cohen provides a new and insightful analysis of America political economy. . . . The cultural history is vibrant and compelling throughout."&#x2014;<i>The American Historian</i></p><br><br><p>"With shimmering vignettes, Cohen's <i>Luxurious Citizens</i> draws us into the contested terrain of the early republic's clamoring eager consumers. And with uncommonly compelling arguments, Cohen guides us through a profoundly original interpretation of the years between Revolution and Civil War."&#x2014;Cathy Matson, University of Delaware</p><br><br><p>"Combining a range of sources, including political tracts and speeches, business records and advertisements, and consumers' letters and diaries, Cohen artfully weaves together six chapters to show how Americans came to see shopping as a civic duty rather than a sacrifice."&#x2014;<i>Journal of Social History</i></p><br><br><p>"<i>Luxurious Citizens</i> demonstrates wonderfully how American political culture in the nineteenth century created 'citizen consumers' as an important constituency. With a sophisticated blend of sources from the worlds of culture, policy, and business, Joanna Cohen reexamines familiar political and economic debates to reveal new meanings of consumption in American society."&#x2014;Ellen Hartigan-O'Connor, University of California, Davis</p></p><h2>Killing Grounds (Kate Shugak Mystery/Dana Stabenow)</h2><p>Lending a hand on a salmon boat under the Alaskan summer sun, Kate Shugak reels in some unusual suspects in the murder of a roundly despised commercial fisherman, including his troubled teenaged son and his less-than-grief-stricken widow.</p><p>Like Nevada Barr, Dana Stabenow writes mysteries so firmly rooted in the natural world that their sense of place becomes a vital part of the plot. In this book about Native Alaskan crime solver Kate Shugak, the ocean and the men who fish it for salmon are described in such vivid detail that you'll never look at a salmon steak the same way again. When a particularly nasty fisherman is murdered, there's no end of suspects--including members of Kate's own family. The story also sports a richly ironic undertone of political incorrectness, as Kate muses about the forest rangers, "who wanted to annex every square foot of land they saw and keep it pristine and inviolate, unsullied by human hand. They failed to recall that the indigenous peoples who came across the Bering land bridge during the last Ice Age had their hands all over anything that had the remotest possibility of nutritional value, and were every bit as much of the landscape and the wheel of life as the fish and the birds and the mammals." Previous Shugak sorties in paperback include <i>Breakup</i>, <i>Blood Will Tell</i>, <i>Play with Fire</i>, and <i>A Cold-Blooded Business</i>.Dana Stabenow was born in Anchorage and raised on a 75-foot fish tender in the Gulf of Alaska. She knew there was a warmer, drier job out there somewhere and found it in writing. Her first crime fiction novel, A Cold Day for Murder, won an Edgar award. Her first thriller, Blindfold Game, hit the New York Times bestseller list.</p><h2>Licensing Art 101, Third Edition Updated: Publishing and Licensing Your Artwork for Profit</h2><p><p>This comprehensive handbook guides readers step-by-step through the licensing and publishing industry.

In 1897, when the magazine was founded, photography as a technique of illustration was gaining acceptance in publishing; because of the long exposure times needed for those early shots, architecture as a subject was a natural. These two initial volumes in a series reproduce for the first time some of the photos commissioned by the magazine. In Hall's work, 20 English homes are illustrated, and Hall includes lengthy family histories, provenance, and pertinent anecdotes about each. Many of the old structures have not fared well over the years; indeed, many exist only on glass negatives. The second volume covers French chateaux dating from the 12th through the 20th centuries. Although this work does not concentrate as closely on family lineage and the provenance of the homes, much attention is focused on the work of the great English photographer Evans. Evans worked for the magazine anonymously, tramping through the French countryside and taking hundreds of pictures of buildings, many of which are today virtually in ruins. Nearly a century later, Binney had to face the daunting task of identifying the artist's uncataloged negatives. These photographs are an invaluable record not only of the architecture, gardens, and decorating schemes of pre-World War I France but also of one of the pioneers of "photojournalism." Both books are highly recommended for libraries with strong history, architecture, and photography collections.<br><i>Margarete Gross, Chicago </i><br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Myrtlewood Cookbook: Pacific Northwest Home Cooking</h2><p>Experience beautiful home cooking that takes its cues from the kitchen gardens and forest harvests of the Pacific Northwest.

It has been reorganized into four parts: basic analysis, analysis of feedback systems, advanced analysis, and nonlinear feedback control. <b> </b> Updated content includes subjects which have proven useful in nonlinear control design in recent years&#x2014;new in the 3rd edition are: expanded treatment of passivity and passivity-based control; integral control, high-gain feedback, recursive methods, optimal stabilizing control, control Lyapunov functions, and observers. <b> </b> For use as a self-study or reference guide by engineers and applied mathematicians. </p></p><p><p> This text is intended for a first-year graduate-level course on nonlinear systems or control. It may also be used for self study or reference by engineers and applied mathematicians. It is an outgrowth of my experience teaching the nonlinear systems course at Michigan State University, East Lansing. Students taking this course have had background in electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, or applied mathematics. The prerequisite for the course is a graduate-level course in linear systems, taught at the level of the texts by Antsaklis and Michel 9, Chen 35, Kailath 94), or Rugh 158. The linear systems prerequisite allowed me not to worry about introducing the concept of "state" and to refer freely to "transfer functions," "state transition matrices," and other linear system concepts. The mathematical background is the usual level of calculus, differential equations, and matrix theory that any graduate student in engineering or mathematics would have. In the Appendix, I have collected a few mathematical facts that are used throughout the book. </p> <p> I have written the text in such a way that the level of mathematical sophistication increases as we advance from chapter to chapter. This is why the second chapter is written in an elementary context. Actually, this chapter could be taught at senior, or even junior, level courses without difficulty. This is also the reason I have split the treatment of Lyapunov stability into two parts. In Sections 4.1 through 4.3, I introduce the essence of Lyapunov stability for autonomous systems where I do not have to worry about technicalities such as uniformity, class <i>k</i> functions, etc. In Sections 4.4 through 4.6, I present Lyapunov stability in a more general setup that accommodates nonautonomous systems and allows for a deeper look into advanced aspects of the stability theory. The level of mathematical sophistication at the end of Chapter 4 is the level to which I like to bring the students, so that they can comfortably read the rest of the text. </p> <p> There is yet a higher level of mathematical sophistication that is assumed in writing the proofs in the Appendix. These proofs are not intended for classroom use. They are included to make the text on one hand, self contained, and, on the other, to respond to the need or desire of some students to read such proofs, such as students continuing on to conduct Ph.D. research into nonlinear systems or control theory. Those students can continue to read the Appendix in a self-study manner. </p> <p> This third edition has been written with the following goals in mind: </p> <ol> <li>To make the book (especially the early chapters) more accessible to first-year graduate students. As an example of the changes made toward that end, note the change in Chapter 3: All the material on mathematical background, the contraction mapping theorem, and the proof of the existence and uniqueness theorem have been moved to the Appendix. Several parts of the books have been rewritten to improve readability.</li> <li>To reorganize the book in such a way that makes it easier to structure nonlinear systems or control courses around it. In the new organization, the book has four parts, as shown in the flow chart. A course on nonlinear systems analysis will cover material from Parts 1, 2, and 3, while a course on nonlinear control will cover material from Parts 1, 2, and 4.</li> <li>To update the material of the book to include topics or results that have proven to be useful in nonlinear control design in recent years. New to the third addition are the: expanded treatment of passivity and passivity-based control, integral control, sliding mode control, and high-gain observers. Moreover, bifurcation is introduced in the context of second-order systems. On the technical side, the reader will find Kurzweil's converse Lyapunov theorem, nonlocal results in Chapters 10 and 11, and new results on integral; control and gain scheduling.</li> <li>To update the exercises. More than 170 new exercises have been included.</li> </ol></p><h2>George and Martha: Back in Town</h2><p>Five additional stories about the friendship between two hippos: &#34;The Box,&#34; &#34;The High Board,&#34; &#34;The Trick,&#34; &#34;The Job,&#34; &#34;The Book.&#34;</p><p>James Marshall (1942&#x2013;1992) created dozens of exuberant and captivating books for children, including The Stupids, Miss Nelson Is Missing!, and the ever-popular George and Martha books.

Connell is expert at sketching the banalities and trivialities of middle-class values, customs, and habits. Like Mr. Bridge, its counterpart, Mrs. Bridge is comprised of over one hundred titled chapters, containing vignettes, an image, a fragment of conversation, an event all building powerfully toward the completed group portrait of a family, closely knit on the surface but deeply divided beneath by loneliness, boredom, misunderstandings, isolation, sexual longing, and terminal alienation. With a surgeon&#x2019;s skill Connell cuts away the middle-class security blanket of uniformity to expose the arrested development beneath. Mrs. Bridge recedes more and more into doubt and confusion as her three children and husband become more remote and silent.

His subjects are commonplace, seemingly innocuous at times: the encounter between a man and a dog, a collection of dolls, a walk among trees. But always the deceptively simple external phenomenon is seen as the symbol, the catalyst of an intensely felt inner experience. As he confided to his friend Frau Wunderly-Volkart: "Oh, how often one longs to speak a few degrees more deeply! My prose... lies deeper... but one gets only a minimal layer further down; one&#x2019;s left with a mere intimation of the kind of speech that may be possible THERE where silence reigns." In addition to occasional pieces and notebook entries, this volume contains selections from the strange and haunting "Dream-Book," the lyrical "Lay of the Love and Death of Cornet Christoph Rilke," and the entire "Rodin-Book"&#x2013;&#x2013;Rilke&#x2019;s appreciation of the great sculptor whom he had served as secretary.</p><p><p><strong>RAINER MARIA RILKE</strong> (1875&#x2013;1926) is one of the greatest poets who ever wrote in the German language.

Laura Foster, a simple country girl, was murdered and her lover Tom Dula was hanged for the crime. The sensational elements in the case attracted national attention: a man and his beautiful, married lover accused of murdering the other-woman; the former governor of North Carolina spearheading the defense; and a noble gesture from the prisoner on the eve of his execution, saving the woman he really loved.&nbsp;<br><br>With the help of historians, lawyers, and researchers, Sharyn McCrumb visited the actual sites, studied the legal evidence, and uncovered a missing piece of the story that will shock those who think they already know what happened&#x2014;and may also bring belated justice to an innocent man. What seemed at first to be a sordid tale of adultery and betrayal was transformed by the new discoveries into an Appalachian Wuthering Heights. Tom Dula and Ann Melton had a profound romance spoiled by the machinations of their servant, Pauline Foster.<br><br>Bringing to life&nbsp;the star-crossed lovers of this mountain tragedy, Sharyn McCrumb gifts&nbsp;understanding and compassion to her compelling tales of Appalachia, and solidifies her status as one of today's great Southern writers.</p><p>SHARYN MCCRUMB's&nbsp;books have been named Notable Books of the Year by the <i>New York Times</i>, she has been named as a &#x201c;Virginia Women of History&#x201d; and won&nbsp;the Appalachian Writer of the Year Award.THE BALLAD OF TOM DOOLEY<p><i>What did I know about murder cases that a man&#x2019;s life should lie in my hands?</i> I had spent the whole of my adult life in politics, except for a few years on a mountain circuit court, a decade before that trial. A war ago.</p><p>This tale is not a penny-dreadful thriller, penned by the likes of Mr. Wilkie Collins. Look elsewhere for clues and footprints and the trappings of a puzzle story&#x2014;<i>and go to the devil if you try to make this tale into one.</i></p><p>A case of law is a chess game for those who make their living at it, and a great sorrow for those who get caught up in its web.</p><p>A man died bravely, doing perhaps the only noble thing he ever achieved in his brutal, useless life. Another fifty years of living would not have improved him, for he had only a minute&#x2019;s worth of courage, and he spent that.</p><p>That is the burden of this story, and it would shine brighter if there were a good woman at hand with the heart and the wit to tell it well. But we have no good woman to speak out for the doomed man&#x2014;only a vain and selfish ditch rose, who rightly feared for her own life, and a raddled slut who delighted in the destruction she wrought single-handed. One of those wretched women is also my client, for the pair was arrested together, and bound over to stand trial for the same crime, but I had deemed it better for all concerned that they be tried separately for this deed, and I vowed to ask for severance as soon as I was able.</p><p>The young soldier was the first to face the judge, and it was he that I was concerned with at the outset. I would do what I could for him.</p><p>People will tell this story for a century, though I&#x2019;m damned if I know why. There&#x2019;s little enough to it. No doubt they will sing about it, and spin fanciful tales, and act it out, turning all its principals into Sunday-school sweethearts and black-hearted villains. It will all be nonsense. At least I remember what was real.</p><p><i>I remember.</i></p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>I am weary and garrulous in my old age, sitting by the fire in my fine Washington home, and thinking back twenty-odd years, to when I was domiciled here in the old Capitol Prison, instead of in the United States Senate, where I have been nigh on ever since. I have been paging through my personal papers, idly speculating about whether I should like to write my memoirs someday. They would make interesting reading, though I do say so myself. One might trace my progress from backwoods farm boy to country lawyer, to Congressman, and then to Colonel of the 26th North Carolina during the War. I saw action on the front lines in Virginia. That was about as much soldiering as I cared to experience, so when the opportunity arose, I got myself elected Governor. From the Governor&#x2019;s Palace in Raleigh, I sat out the remainder of the hostilities, skirmishing with bureaucrats and trying to protect the people of my state from both armies. They clapped me in prison here in Washington at the War&#x2019;s end, for my trouble, but I didn&#x2019;t take it personally&#x2014;all the governors were there, so I did not lack for society. In a few weeks, they let us all out again, and I went home to a state made so desolate by war that my own personal ruin hardly mattered. I began again.</p><p>I had to practice a little law after the War ended, before those same trifling government bureaucrats saw fit to let me back into the congress I had unwillingly left when my home state seceded. I do not mean to ever leave Congress again. I shall die here, protecting the interests of my fellow Tarheels for as long as God grants me breath and strength.</p><p>A fine row house in the District of Columbia city is a far cry from my birthplace&#x2014;a log cabin in the Carolina backcountry&#x2014;but from my boyhood I could see my way clear to getting here as surely as I could see that blue haze of mountains that walled us off from the state of Tennessee. I come of good stock, though you might not think it, for we looked no more prosperous or cultured than most of our frontier neighbors, but my father&#x2019;s father had fought in the Revolution. He wintered at Valley Forge with General Washington, and fought alongside him at Brandywine, Germantown, and Monmouth. I am proudest, though, of the fact that he fought closer to home&#x2014;at King&#x2019;s Mountain on the South Carolina border, just west of Charlotte. In 1780 a group of backcountry volunteers, calling themselves The Overmountain Men, engaged the British forces there, and defeated them in an hour, killing their commander, and proving that untrained colonials could defeat the mighty British army. George Washington&#x2019;s troops were losing the War to the north, and that little victory on a Carolina hillside proved to the rest of the country that winning was possible. It was the turning point of the War, and I was proud that my family had been part of it.</p><p>On that little mountain farm where I grew up, we plowed furrows, and slopped hogs, and hewed firewood, but we were never allowed to forget that we were destined for greater things. My grandfather had left a library of five hundred books, and my mother read to us each night when the chores were done. My father died young, though, and so the way to prosperity was a steep and thorny path for us. I got some schooling over in Tennessee at Washington College, so that I had the rudiments of Latin, and composition, debate, and ancient history, but my father&#x2019;s death ended that idyll, and before long I was clerking in a fine resort hotel in Warm Springs. That, too, was an education, though. It was a zoo for the aristocracy, and I learned to pass muster as one of them.</p><p>I read law in Asheville, and then begged and borrowed the funds to take me to the University of North Carolina for the formal study of law. I meant to get elected to something before long, and so I did, but for a few years in my youth I practiced law on the circuit court out of Asheville. There was little in those experiences worth mentioning in a senator&#x2019;s memoirs.</p><p>But this Wilkes County case&nbsp;... That came later in my career, and in it, I was defending a man on trial for his life. I had thought of including the tale in my memoirs, because it became quite a celebrated trial. <i>The New York Herald</i> even sent a reporter down to cover it. But the public finds it hard to recognize success or skill if one ultimately loses the case, so perhaps I will not include it, after all. I have had enough adventures for two lifetimes, without telling that sad little tale.</p><p>That Wilkes County court case constituted my brief hiatus from public life, falling in 1866, when, having been the Confederate Governor of North Carolina, I was barred from running for public office yet awhile, so, when they let me out of Capitol Prison with the rest of the Rebel governors, I bided my time and supported Harriette and the boys by returning to the practice of law. Perhaps I thought that my renown and popularity would make up for any deficiencies I might have in my long-disused courtroom skills.</p><p>The law was never much more than a means to an end for me, anyhow. I was always happy to help people escape what was coming to them, which is mostly what a defense attorney does, but from the very beginning I was only marking time until I got elected to something. But for the War, I would have never looked back.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>A frail girl was stabbed to death in the foothills of Wilkes County, and nigh on everybody there knows who did it. Well<i>, I</i> didn&#x2019;t know. I was practicing law in Charlotte, some ninety miles away, and I was only called in to defend the man they had arrested, a complete stranger to me, despite what people have said to the contrary over the years. He was a Confederate veteran, as was I, but we never served together, and would not have been acquainted even if we had, for I began and ended my military service as a colonel, and he stayed a sickly private and a drummer boy. We were worlds apart, except perhaps to people who looked at our lives on paper.</p><p>This twenty-two-year-old former soldier got himself arrested, and I in my infinite wisdom got the trial moved to the next county, where nobody knew any more about it than I did. My intentions were good. And I suppose I could not have done otherwise, even if I had been more in possession of the facts. In the end, a lawyer must do his client&#x2019;s bidding, and I did that.</p><p>God help us both. I did that.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>I expect that in years to come there will be more people wondering why I took this case than there will be wondering if he did it.</p><p>Oh, why did I agree to represent a man, generally accorded by my learned colleagues in the legal profession to be guilty, who could not have paid for a shot of whiskey, much less an attorney for his defense? An idle, amoral Confederate veteran, accused of stabbing a young girl to death and burying her body in the woods.</p><p>Well, <i>somebody</i> had to represent him. Any country lawyer will tell you that. If we managed to get Satan himself into a courtroom, it would be some lawyer&#x2019;s lot to defend him, and to argue, no doubt, that he is a hard-working fellow.</p><p><i>But why me?</i></p><p>I don&#x2019;t know that I had any choice in the matter. The Wilkes County judge appointed me, and ordered me to defend this young man pro bono. It is a fine sentiment, pro bono. For the public good and in the interest of justice, a lawyer can be assigned to an indigent defendant, and he must represent his client completely without charge. This ensures that the poor are accorded a defense, but it can be hard lines on a struggling attorney, and I expect that the temptation would be great to rush through the case, and move on to more lucrative matters. A man&#x2019;s life is at stake, though; if I shirked my duty in so grave a matter as this, I would never sleep again.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t suppose the judge pulled my name out of a hat. He could have found lawyers a-plenty in the surrounding counties without reaching all the way to Charlotte to fetch one. Perhaps he intended the appointment as a favor. Here was I forced to practice law, but lacking in experience, and perhaps he thought that a notorious murder trial would set my name before the general public, so that people would queue up to retain my services for their legal requirements.</p><p>I am sensible of the honor, but I could scarcely afford the opportunity. There I was, former Governor of the state of North Carolina, and before that a U.S. Congressman, and, in-between, for a few ill-considered months, a colonel in the Army of the Confederacy, and, only incidentally, an attorney licensed to practice law in my home state. I never thought I&#x2019;d be called upon to do so again after all the loftier honors I had achieved. Indeed, I hoped not, but our fortunes shift like the tides, and the fall of the Confederacy had left me high and dry, penniless, jobless, and free only on the sufferance of the United States President. In those days I was rich only in friends.</p><p>From the corridors of power to a stuffy little courtroom in a town in Iredell County that is only on the map two days a week. When I charted the course of my life, that was an unforeseen development, but there I was.</p><p>If I should ever have the ear of posterity, it would take me a good many words to talk my way out of that one. But I am both a lawyer and a politician. Words are my stock in trade. This story, though, will be omitted from my memoirs. After all, for all the protracted nature of the legal proceedings, the case only took up a few days of my time, and its outcome did me no credit. It is a mere footnote in the long and illustrious history of a dedicated public servant. I shall not speak of it.</p><p>From time to time, though, that poor wretch crosses my mind, and before I force my thoughts on to other things, I repress a shudder, and think, &#x201c;There but for the grace of God, go I.&#x201d;</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>I was born beyond the pale of gentrified civilization, as was that young man in the dock on trial for his life. You might think that coincidence of circumstance would have made for common ground between him and me, but the truth is that we could not have been farther apart had one of us been born on the moon. My childhood poverty was only in material want, but in heritage, intellect, learning, and morality, my family had wealth beyond avarice.</p><p>For reasons I am at a loss to explain, this Wilkes County case became a cause celebre among the national press, and I fear that whenever people read about the sordid circumstances of these wretched people, they will attempt to tar all the inhabitants of the Carolina mountains with the same brush, which is hard lines on the honest and educated people who choose to live in those mountains. In defense of my fellow countrymen, I offer up the example of my own life.</p><p>The Ballad of Tom Dooley Copyright ï¿½ 2011 by Sharyn McCrumb.</p></p><h2>Complete Book Of Chess Openings</h2><p>Paperback: 159 pages Publisher: Rowman Littlefield; Edition and Printing Not Stated edition (January 1, 1957) ISBN-10: 0389002291 ISBN-13: 978-0389002291 Product Dimensions: 8 x 5.3 x 0.4 inches</p><p>Fred Reinfeld (1910-1964) was for many years among the strongest chess players in the country.

Under the pseudonym Edmund Crispin, he wrote nine detective novels and 42 short stories, combining farcical situations with literary references and sharply observed characterisation. His professional film scores included the well-known scores for the Carry On series. Montgomery graduated from St. John&#39;s College, Oxford in 1943 and was part of a famous literary circle including Kingsley Amis and Philip Larkin. In addition to his reputation as a leader in the field of mystery genre, he was the regular crime-fiction reviewer for the Sunday Times from 1967 and contributed to many periodicals and newspapers and edited science-fiction anthologies. After the golden years of the 1950s he retired from the limelight to live out a hermetic existence in Totnes in Devonshire until his death in 1978.`Both the mature and the discerning young choose to pick up one of Crispin&#39;s beautifully turned crime novels&#39; The Times `Crispin isn&#39;t in it for the mystery, but for the enigmas&#39; Guardian `His books are full of high spirits and excellent jokes, with constant literary allusions and an atmosphere of bibulous good humour.

The life of an epoch swirled around him&#x2014;but though his contemporaries appreciated and admired him, they failed to understand him.<br><br>Few have even attempted to tackle Tiepolo&#x2019;s series of thirty-three bizarre and haunting etchings, the <i>Capricci</i> and the <i>Scherzi</i>, but Roberto Calasso rises to the challenge, interpreting them as chapters in a dark narrative that contains the secret of Tiepolo&#x2019;s art. Blooming ephebes, female Satyrs, Oriental sages, owls, snakes: we will find them all, as well as Punchinello and Death, within the pages of this book, along with Venus, Time, Moses, numerous angels, Cleopatra, and Beatrice of Burgundy&#x2014;a motley company always on the go.<br><br>Calasso makes clear that Tiepolo was more than a dazzling intermezzo in the history of painting. Rather, he represented a particular way of meeting the challenge of form: endowed with a fluid, seemingly effortless style, Tiepolo was the last incarnation of that peculiar Italian virtue <i>sprezzatura</i>, the art of not seeming artful.</p><p>Born in Florence, Roberto Calasso lives in Milan, where he is<br>publisher of Adelphi. He is the author of <i>The Ruin of Kasch</i>, <i>The marriage of Cadmus and Harmony</i>, which was the winner of the Prix Veillon and the Prix du Meilleur Livre Etranger, and <i>Ka</i>.What happened with Tiepolo was the same thing that was to happen with certain imposing and mysterious ancient objects like the Shang bronzes: those aspects that resisted interpretation were considered <i>decorative</i>, while those too charged with meaning were labeled <i>ornamental</i>. The twenty-three <i>Scherzi</i>, which are a kind of <i>Art of the Fugue</i> in Tiepolo&#x2019;s work&#x2014;variations built on an established repertoire of characters, accessories, talismans, and gestures&#x2014;were seen with some condescension as bizarre entertainments with a hint of the disquieting about them. Many took pains to repeat something that is obvious, but perhaps true: Tiepolo marks the definitive end of an epoch. But they failed to notice the unprecedented accumulation of venom and sweetness contained in that <i>motus in fine velocior.</i> <br><br>Tiepolo: the last breath of happiness in Europe. And, like all true happiness, it was full of dark sides destined not to fade away, but to get the upper hand. Recognizable by its effortless, unfettered air, doomed to disappear afterward. Compared with Tiepolo&#x2019;s happiness, that of Fragonard is based on tacit exclusions. But Tiepolo excludes nothing. Not even Death, who joins the number of his characters without drawing too much attention to himself. The happiness that Tiepolo emanates did not necessarily spring from within. Perhaps there were many occasions when he told it to come back later, because right now he had a job to finish and he was behind schedule.<br><br>The ultimate peculiarity of Italian culture, the quality it could be proudest of, also because over the centuries it has proved untranslatable into other languages (whereas by contrast the meaning of the word has become obscure and remote for the majority of Italians), is what is known as <i>sprezzatura.</i> Baldassare Castiglione defined it as follows, in complete contrast with the thing he advised people to &#x201c;steer clear of as far as possible, as if from the sharpest and most dangerous rocks,&#x201d; in other words &#x201c;affectation.&#x201d; According to Castiglione, the remedy for the &#x201c;bane of affectation&#x201d; consisted in &#x201c;using in all things a certain nonchalance [<i>sprezzatura</i>] that may conceal art and demonstrate that what one does and says is done without effort and almost without thinking.&#x201d; A gloss followed: &#x201c;From this, I believe, does much grace derive.&#x201d; And a decisive consequence: &#x201c;It can be said that true art is that which does not seem to be art; nor should a man study anything more than the concealment of it.&#x201d;<br><br>For those looking for an example of <i>sprezzatura</i>, no one is likely to be more convincing than Tiepolo, who for a lifetime did his utmost to conceal, behind his blinding speed of execution, the subtly aberrant nature of his subjects to the point that he succeeded in having his most daring and enigmatic works, the <i>Scherzi</i>, passed off as facile amusements. If no one ever took Tiepolo completely seriously, we might almost say that this was what he wanted. He never had symbols and meanings assume <i>pose</i>, with the result that those symbols and meanings were generally overlooked. In the <i>Scherzi </i>too, although no fewer than eleven of the twenty-three plates are steeped in an almost unbearable tension bound up with the act of looking at something unknown, others are imbued with a sort of torpor, as in the two portrayals of family groups at rest, one group of satyrs and another of humans. The <i>Scherzi</i> have no obligatory meaning (as was the case later with Goya&#x2019;s <i>The Disasters of War</i>), but a physiological rhythm, an alternation of psychic atmospheres in which no single element prevails over the others. Even when meanings gather densely in his images with brazen insolence, Tiepolo never abandons the air of one who does things &#x201c;without effort and almost without thinking.&#x201d; He does this so well that some are led to believe he didn&#x2019;t think at all. And in this way he protected his thinking from intruders.<br><br>&#x201c;Tiepolo was a happy painter by nature,&#x201d; wrote his contemporary Anton Maria Zanetti, son of Alessandro&#x2014;and he was not forgiven for that happiness. Zanetti added: &#x201c;But this didn&#x2019;t stop him from assiduously cultivating his fertile spirit.&#x201d; This pleased some even less: the idea that Tiepolo possessed more erudition than he admitted to. In 1868 Charles Blanc outlined a judgment of Tiepolo that was to be picked up on and elaborated by many critics for decades: &#x201c;His fire is mere artifice, a firework display; his abundance has more to do with temperament than with spirit.&#x201d; It was therefore necessary to deny Tiepolo access to the area reserved for the spirit. But for what original sin, if not the &#x201c;happiness&#x201d; that seemed to deprive his work of a certain praiseworthy decorum? Tiepolo always had &#x201c;stern critics&#x201d; against him. This was so already during his lifetime, as Zanetti himself tells us when he mentions that Tiepolo had reawakened &#x201c;the dormant, happy, most graceful ideas of Paolo Caliari.&#x201d; The idea that Tiepolo was a sort of born-again Veronese was deeply disturbing. Hence the observation that &#x201c;the forms of the heads are no less graceful and beautiful; but the stern critics will let no one say that they have life and soul like those of the old Master.&#x201d; <br><br>After having a go in various directions (toward Piazzetta, toward Bencovich), with the frescoes in the Palazzo Patriarcale in Udine the young Tiepolo shows his hand: to bathe the world in an all-embracing light that would never be drab. And, as Giuseppe Fiocco wrote, &#x201c;he breaks out like a fanfare.&#x201d; The supremely frivolous angel that tells Sarah of the imminent birth of Isaac is also the herald of an entire tribe&#x2014;Tiepolo&#x2019;s tribe&#x2014;that for the next few decades was to spread out on the ceilings of churches and palaces, as well as on canvas and copper plates. Apparently Tiepolo was not remotely interested in subduing the totality of appearance. Right from the start he wanted to take appearance and, using invisible shears, cut out from it a segment of related and secret correspondences: between ferns and the faces of young boys, lopsided tree trunks and halberds, drapes and the busts of Nymphs and courtesans, greyhounds and ominous Orientals. Tiepolo&#x2019;s patrons committed themselves, together with him, to welcoming his entire tribe, which moved from one neighborhood to another, from villa to villa, as far as Wï¿½rzburg and Madrid. It was &#x201c;the prophetic tribe with blazing eyes&#x201d; that Baudelaire was later to call up, an unstoppable motley caravan that dragged along with them all their assorted trappings, the flotsam and jetsam of history. They could always serve, from time to time, as scenic accessories. Without declaring or stressing this (since he never declared or stressed anything), Tiepolo allowed something to happen that would soon become an insuppressible component of all experience: the transformation of history&#x2014;and of all the past&#x2014;into phantasmagoria, material suited equally to providing the scenery for a fairground sideshow or to becoming a haunting image, pure power of the mind. <br><br>Why an angel was needed&#x2014;that angel in Udine in particular&#x2014;to herald the unfolding of Tiepolo&#x2019;s painting was illustrated with eloquent ease by Giorgio Manganelli: &#x201c;Tiepolo is not only a painter of angels, but one has the impression that he had a superstitious fancy, ready to run riot at the first beam of light to catch his eye. It could be Jupiter, or a harbinger of fertility to the pensive Sarah: it was always a mantled light, a cloud with precious sandals, a miraculously stable and elegant glow.&#x201d; A description that introduced a definitive judgment: &#x201c;He is an idolater of light disguised as a human being.&#x201d; These few words provide the indispensable elements that allow us to get closer to Tiepolo: light, theater (the mask, disguise). And above all idolatry, a natural reverence for the image. <br><br>Baudelaire made his debut with a <i>Salon</i> review and, a few years later, on finding himself obliged to write another, he spoke of &#x201c;that kind of tedious article known as the Salon.&#x201d; Working one&#x2019;s way through the vast bituminous expanses that opened up every spring in the rooms of the Louvre or, later, in the Palais des Beaux-Arts, must have been fairly depressing. &#x201c;No explosions; no undiscovered geniuses,&#x201d; but above all a succession of characters in vacuous or mawkish poses, often portrayed in period costume. <i>All the names of history</i> were mobilized, without ever granting the past its salutary foreignness, but reducing all things to a modest range of perfunctory expressions. What was missing, what air was lacking in that oppressive art to make Baudelaire feel the need to escape it? He felt at home only among Boudin&#x2019;s clouds, &#x201c;those clouds with fantastic, luminous forms, those chaotic shadows, those green and pink immensities, suspended and superimposed one over the other, those gaping furnaces, those firmaments of black or violet satin, creased, rolled-up, or torn, those horizons in mourning, glittering with molten metal.&#x201d; Here, in a kind of theurgical process, Baudelaire ventured far beyond the admittedly delightful Boudin, who acted solely as a fortuitous device for evocation (this is how magic works). What Baudelaire was calling up was that all-embracing air no longer present in painting after the French Revolution. And that air had a name: Tiepolo. The entire eighteenth century was branded, like a herd of cattle, by that absence. One day, without realizing it, it had forever lost the sovereign sense of <i>sprezzatura</i>, of facility and fluidity of movement. That grand air, on a measure with the skies, which for the last time had been perceived with Tiepolo and his family. Of whom Baudelaire knew nothing, because he had not come across their works (no other country had been as reluctant to welcome them as France, a jealous guardian of its affectations and feeling of sovereignty). But with visionary precision he called up that negative silhouette, based on what was lacking, of an air no longer breathed in the overloaded Paris of the Second Empire. <br><br>We know very little about Tiepolo&#x2019;s life and that little is exclusively concerned with his work as a painter. Of his personal life we know almost nothing. Yet right from his youth Tiepolo was famous. But his life was as transparent as glass: no one noticed it. They were all looking at the landscape that opened up in the background. This too was why Tiepolo was the right person to impersonate painting&#x2019;s epilogue, just as in a theater performance there is an actor whose function is solely to appear at the end and make an imperfectible bow to the audience. And so painting took its leave of us&#x2014;at least in the particular, singular, irretrievable sense it had acquired over roughly five centuries in Europe, where countless painters had all conformed to a single notion of painting and moved as a unified whole of immaculate grace and lightness, like certain extremely fat actors such as Sydney Greenstreet. During those centuries, painting was primarily a task assigned by the world, through various, fundamentally indifferent procedures. The only essential thing was that a commission arrived from the outside, in the same way as a courier received the order to set off. Perhaps Tiepolo never painted if not on commission&#x2014;and where one suspects there was no commission (as in the case of the <i>Scherzi</i> or the last small canvases portraying the flight into Egypt), the work gives off an irresistible scent of secrecy and the forbidden. <br><br>After, we were left with artists. Of course, there were still patrons, both public and private, but something had gone irremediably wrong. Painting steadily became a monologizing activity, a calm delirium that started and stopped every day, with the hours of daylight, behind the windows of a studio. Artists remained, brimming with moods, whims, caprices, and idiosyncrasies. And in the end even they risked disappearing.<br>Among the old masters, no one lends himself less than Tiepolo to psychological and dramatic reconstructions. There is no trace of any &#x201c;struggle with the demon.&#x201d; Contemporaries have left no key with which to unlock his psyche and moods. But neither can we say that he is elusive because of a dearth of documentary evidence. On the contrary, as soon as the talk got around to contemporary painting, people often wrote about Tiepolo. But without fail they did so to refer to his renown and his virtuosity. No aspect of him as a person attracted any attention whatsoever. Nor has anyone handed down any anecdotes or significant episodes that might have occurred in his life. Everything seemed to run smoothly, in a series of commissions, always accompanied by worries about finishing in time or at least not too late. <br><br>Likewise, with regard to his works&#x2014;except for the constant references to Veronese&#x2014;the comments were never any more than succinct. Tiepolo&#x2019;s fame was described in functional terms: the diarist Gradenigo defined him as a matchless specialist, &#x201c;the most acclaimed, for his historical paintings of ceilings of salons, rooms, and churches in fresco and in oils.&#x201d; And, even though the greats of the world vied for his works, from the &#x201c;Court of Muscovy&#x201d; to that of Madrid, Tiepolo received only sparing, occasionally graceless recognition. He was over sixty when the recently established Accademia di Parma proposed to accept him as an &#x201c;<i>amatore</i>&#x201d; (connoisseur). And only thanks to the intervention of Anton Maria Zanetti, who pointed out this faux pas, did the Academy decide to nominate him &#x201c;Honorary Academician.&#x201d; It was as if the people around him had trouble admiring him without taking precautionary measures. And his death was followed by a prolonged spell of obscurity. <br><br>From his heavenly ceiling, Tiepolo must have sketched a slight, satisfied smile when the two most knowledgeable scholars to deal with him in recent years&#x2014;Svetlana Alpers and Richard Baxandall&#x2014;found themselves obliged to state with one voice that &#x201c;the man&#x2019;s personality&#x201d; had &#x201c;totally eluded&#x201d; them. But he didn&#x2019;t elude only them. When historians want to say the last word on Tiepolo, in general we are not granted more than a few remarks on the last blaze of Venetian glory and on the vanity of his patrons, with the occasional addition of an evident non sequitur: since his patrons were vain, then Tiepolo must have been vain too. A thinly veiled assumption even in the greatest and most unjust of his critics: Roberto Longhi, who did not go so far as to treat him with the extreme iniquity he reserved for Canova (&#x201c;the sculptor born dead, whose heart lies in the Frari, whose hand is in the Accademia and the rest I don&#x2019;t know where&#x201d;). In any event he made Tiepolo the Bad Guy to set in opposition to the Good Guy par excellence, who was unfailingly Caravaggio, to the point that Longhi felt the need to have them meet and converse in heaven, as if there too Tiepolo had to be persecuted by someone ready to lecture him, despite all the well-founded doubts we might have regarding Caravaggio&#x2019;s suitability for the role of a moralizing tutor. Yet this otherworldly dialogue composed by Longhi shortly after his <i>Viatico per cinque secoli di pittura veneziana</i>, in which he penned his irrevocable condemnation of Tiepolo, sounds like a surreptitious palinode. Even though Caravaggio lashes out at Tiepolo from start to finish, accusing him first and foremost of not sharing his &#x201c;craving for truth,&#x201d; even though he has him understand that, instead of his tawny-haired and rosy-skinned Armidas, he would have done better to paint a &#x201c;brawl among swarthy gondoliers on the tremulous water,&#x201d; it is Tiepolo who makes the &#x201c;lethal thrust&#x201d;&#x2014;a far more effective blow than the summary drubbing he has been subjected to until that moment. The opportunity presents itself when Caravaggio reminds Tiepolo, in indignant tones, how widespread the custom of wearing masks was in Venice. But Tiepolo counters this by remark...</p><h2>A Lily of the Field: A Novel (The Inspector Troy Novels, 7)</h2><p>Spanning the tumultuous years 1934 to 1948, John Lawton's <i>A Lily of the Field</i> is a brilliant historical thriller from a master of the form. The book follows two characters&#x2014;Mï¿½ret Voytek, a talented young cellist living in Vienna at the novel's start, and Dr. Karel Szabo, a Hungarian physicist interned in a camp on the Isle of Man. In his seventh Inspector Troy novel, Lawton moves seamlessly from Vienna and Auschwitz to the deserts of New Mexico and the rubble-strewn streets of postwar London, following the fascinating parallels of the physicist Szabo and musician Voytek as fate takes each far from home and across the untraditional battlefields of a destructive war to an unexpected intersection at the novel's close. The result, <i>A Lily of the Field</i>, is Lawton's best book yet, an historically accurate and remarkably written novel that explores the diaspora or two Europeans from the rise of Hitler to the post-atomic age.</p><p>John Lawton is the director of over forty television programs, author of a dozen screenplays, several children&#39;s books and seven Inspector Troy novels. Named by the Daily Telegraph as one of &#39;Fifty Crime Writers to Read Before You Die&#39; and selected by Time magazine as one of &#39;Six Detective Series to Savour,&#39; Lawton&#39;s work has earned him comparisons to John le Carre and Alan Furst. Lawton lives in a remote hilltop village in Derbyshire."An unbearably tense account of two musicians whose lives and careers are shattered in the aftermath of the Anschluss . . . Technically dazzling. Lawton keeps his historical perspective on the war while introducing new characters and adding layers of political subtext to the plot." <i>Marilyn Stasio, The New York Times</i><br><br>"Lawton has always pushed the boundaries of the series crime novel, edging ever closer to broad-canvas historical fiction, but this time he has leaped the fence altogether. Like Dennis Lehane in The Given Day, Lawton introduces multiple characters and stories in a sweeping tale that comes together at a particular historical moment, but unlike Lehane, he does all that without abandoning his series hero or the continuity established in the previous volumes . . . A truly multitextured tale." <i>Booklist</i> (Starred Review)<br><br> Another complex and compellingly readable historic thriller from Lawton, full of profound questions and memorable characters.&#x201d; <i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br> If you love mystery and history, run out and pick up a book by Lawton, author of the superb Inspector Troy novels.&#x201d; Mary Ann Gwinn, <i>The Seattle Times</i><br><br> If the previous six installments in John Lawton's Inspector Troy series haven't made the point adequately, the seventh, <i>A Lily of the Field</i>, makes it again, and solidly: Lawton's thrillers provide a vivid, moving and wonderfully absorbing way to experience life in London and on the Continent before, during and after World War II.&#x201d; Gerald Bartell, <i>The Washington Post</i><br><br> John Lawton finds himself in the same boat as the late Patrick O&#x2019;Brian a sublimely elegant historical novelist as addictive as crack but overlooked by too many readers for too long. Like O&#x2019;Brian, he inhabits his periods&#x2019; 20th-century tipping points witnessed by the rich and richly ambivalent sleuth Troy with an ownership that leaves most history-bothering authors looking like day-trippers.&#x201d; <i>Daily Telegraph</i><br><br> Lawton writes with authority. His characters convince, and so does their world. Admirable, ambitious and haunting, this is the sort of thriller that defies categorisation. I look forward with enthusiasm to the next one.&#x201d; <i>Spectator</i><br><br> John Lawton&#x2019;s books contain such a wealth of period detail, character description and background information that they are lifted out of any category. Every word is enriched by the author&#x2019;s sophistication and irreverent intelligence, by his meticulous research and his wit.&#x201d; <i>Literary Review</i><br><br> Lawton&#x2019;s Troy books are less detective stories or intelligence thrillers than novels which include both murders and spies novels as much about how people and societies grow and change as about the complex messes that Troy finds himself tidying up for his adopted country.&#x201d; <i>Independent</i><br><br> Lawton handles the chronology with exemplary ease and intelligence.&#x201d; <i>Guardian</i><br></p><h2>Ground Zero (The X-Files)</h2><p>A renowned nuclear weapons researcher is not only dead - he's been charred to a radioactive cinder. The incinerated remnants of Dr. Gregory are found curled in the corner of his laboratory at the Edward Teller Nuclear Research Facility near Oakland, California.<br>Since this is a death on Federal property, Mulder and Scully are hastily called in. As FBI agents who specialize in unexplained phenomena, they are the investigators of the X-Files, strange and inexplicable cases which are also mysteries that the FBI doesn't want solved.<br>Dr. Gregory's unique death quickly and clearly becomes an X-File. As Mulder and Scully begin their frustrating work, unearthing the top secret project that Dr. Gregory was working on, they confront a tight-lipped Federal bureaucracy whose job it is to stop questions before they are asked. One by one, Mulder and Scully hit dead ends, closed security clearances, and classified documents that no one wants them to see. But that doesn't stop Mulder and Scully from ripping the lid off Dr. Gregory's illegal project - "Bright Anvil" - a new type of flash nuclear explosive that has all the destructive power of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs, but with a new design that leaves virtually no radioactive fallout. The implications for the modern world are deadly, and some radical protest groups will stop at nothing to prevent the test from happening.<br>When a second victim, completely unrelated to nuclear science or Dr. Gregory is obliterated in the New Mexico desert, and then a third dies the same way in Washington, D.C., Mulder and Scully begin to focus on the frightening dimensions of their task. The bizarre deaths cannot be a coincidence. And as they work to uncover the secret unifying element that unites these deaths, it becomes clear that this twisted puzzle has fatal consequences for the entire world.</p><p>Kevin J.

From early morning (Cast off!/Anchors aweigh./Aye, aye, Captain./Busy day!) to evening (Day is over.

The toylike quality of the boats, cargo, and crew becomes more apparent with each page, so it is no surprise when the bathtub setting is revealed. In the end, a smiling, freshly washed, pajama-clad youngster is taken off to bed, while his still-dripping playthings rest contentedly at tubs edge.

It was empty except for the old Spanish cook and the middle-aged waitress, his daughter, who turned from where she sat smoking at the front counter.</p> <p>"Oh no, you again," she said. It was what she always said.</p> <p>They sat in the deepest booth and put their radios up on the table top next to the ketchup. They ordered burgers and ate them slowly. Nobody came in or out. The waitress took their empty plates and went for coffee. Baker shifted in the silence. </p> <p>"If it's about what I said about Karen," he said.</p> <p>"No," Coglin said, looking out into the rain through the plate glass. "It ain't that."</p> <p>"What then? That EDP? The lady?</p> <p>Coglin turned from the rain to his partner.</p> <p>"You notice how pretty she was?" he said.</p> <p>Baker nodded.</p> <p>"Now that you mention it."</p> <p>"Well, there was a picture of her in her apartment, when she was a kid. She looked like an angel, like a little girl in a fairy tale."</p> <p>"And?" Baker said.</p> <p>Coglin placed his hands on the table in front of him and stared down between them as if some answer lay there in the paled swirls of worn linoleum. </p> <p>"I guess I never really thought about how fucked up it is to be crazy like that," he said quietly, "so alone and fucked up." </p> <p>Baker looked at him in shock. He was at a complete loss for a response. </p> <p>"Does this have anything to do with that fancy TV you're watching now?" he said.</p> <p>Coglin gave him the finger as he looked back out the window. When the waitress brought the check, Baker grabbed it.</p> <p>"Gotta try something radical to cheer your ass up," he said, taking out his wallet.</p> <p>A thin, hunched form appeared up the block, pushing a shopping cart as they exited the coffee shop. As the figure passed under a streetlight, Coglin could see that he was an older black man with a messed-up face: his nose a swollen bag; his eyes purple, puffed slits; his lips split.</p> <p>"Is that Smilin' Ronnie?" Baker said.</p> <p>"Hey, Smilin'!" Coglin called, taking a step toward him. "Hey, Smilin'! What happened?" </p> <p>The old man slowed for a moment, his pulverized face turning vaguely toward the sound of Coglin's voice. Then he began to step quickly. The metal rattling of his cart off the breaks in the sidewalk was suddenly more rapid, like the clatter of a train skipping a stop.</p> <p>"What the hell happened to him?" Baker said. "Took a spill?"</p> <p>"Off a roof, maybe," Coglin said.</p> <p>"Ream knocked him out," said a voice behind them.</p> <p>They both turned. There was a recessed window in the old, dark building beside the coffee shop, and behind its rusting bars stood a small Hispanic boy of no more than seven. He gripped the bars with his little fists like a miniature, irate inmate. Blue television light flashed from the room behind.</p> <p>"C'mon," Coglin said. "You saw it? A little guy like you?"</p> <p>"Shit, yeah," the child said proudly. "Only happened right there on the corner. Ream and his crew, out drinkin' forties, see the bum roll up, so they play them some Knockout."</p> <p>Coglin exchanged glances with his partner.</p> <p>"Knockout," Baker said. "What's that?"</p> <p>The kid rolled his eyes and shook his head with a "where the fuck you been?" expression.</p> <p>"'Knockout,'" he explained slowly. "It's when you coldcock some sucka in his cranium an' try an' knock his ass out with one punch."</p> <p>"What happens after you knock 'im out?" Baker asked. "You rob him?"</p> <p>"Straight up. Stomp his sorry ass, too. But they didn't vic no bum." The kid rolled his eyes again. "What they gonna take? His cans? Shit."</p> <p>"They stomped on him, though, huh?" Coglin said.</p> <p>"Word," the kid said. "Beat his old ass." The dark child laughed for a second, the sound chilling for the unlikely innocence in it, a tickled baby.</p> <p>"And they pissed on 'im. He was lyin' on the ground and they whipped their shits out and showered the stinky old fuck."</p> <p>Coglin checked his desire to reach through the bars and wrap his hands around the kid's throat. </p> <p>"Little man," Coglin said "I don't believe a word of your bullshit. You believe him, Daryl?"</p> <p>"He's spittin' lies," Baker said.</p> <p>"Hey, I seen it," the kid whined. "I seen it right there."</p> <p>"Who did it then?" Baker said. "Who knocked him out?"</p> <p>"Ream did it. Ream turned that old nigga's fuckin' lights out."</p> <p>"Who the fuck's Ream?"</p> <p>"Ream deals rock in the park across from Tubman. Ask anybody. Tall ass nigga with a red Lex. Got silver loops in his ears."</p> <p>"Yeah, we'll see," Coglin said, pushing himself off the wall.</p> <p>"You playin' us," Baker said, "and we're gonna be comin' back."</p> <p>The kid kicked the bars with his small, sneakered foot.</p> <p>"Dang," he called after them, offended. "Why the <i>fuck</i> would I be lying?"</p> <p>Back in the car, Coglin looked off in the direction the bum had gone, a tightness spreading through his body. Adrenaline injecting into his bloodstream at the anticipation of contact. He rolled his neck, his thoughts racing back to the crazy woman. </p> <p>Maybe there were some problems that he or anybody couldn't do anything about. </p> <p>But luckily some punk kids torturing an old defenseless man wasn't one of them. </p> <p>"Whataya say we take a little spin by the park?" he said, starting the car. He stomped on the gas, making the engine roar.</p> <p>Baker smiled and nodded his approval.</p> <p>"Now, that's my Coglin," he said, grasping the dash as the car shot forward. "Let's see how much Mr. Ream likes havin' his own cranium cracked." </p> <p>The drug spot was empty when they pulled in front of the Harriet Tubman projects five minutes later. Normally, the wooden benches facing the street in the adjacent park would be filled with the dealers, circles of hooded young men glancing constantly about like some strange order of cautious persecuted monks.</p> <p>"I think Harriet would have skipped this stop on the ol' Underground Railroad, don't you?" Baker said. "I think she would have taken the express right on past if she had the choice. Business is slow with this rain."</p> <p>Coglin took a deep breath and looked out at the desolate complex of dark stone high-rises, the pale cement paths crisscrossing the mud between. </p> <p>"Yeah," he said. "I've seen that red Lex around, though."</p> <p>"Me, too," Baker said.</p> <p>A train blasted past on the El two blocks away, and its electric spark's soft blue glow lit up the dismal brick for a moment. </p> <p>"You think it was what? Some kind of gang thing?" Coglin said.</p> <p>"Yeah. Some kind of sick initiation," Baker said.

We gotta get back."</p> <p>Coglin turned to his partner.</p> <p>"Smilin' ever show you his union card?"</p> <p>"Used to be a plumber, right?"</p> <p>"Steamfitter," Coglin said. "He told me he used to be the house steamfitter at the Plaza hotel till he got fired."</p> <p>Baker shook his head grimly.</p> <p>"Pissed on him, Daryl," Coglin said. "Who does that? What species?" </p> <p>"I agree," Baker said. "That's some bothersome prehistoric shit. But it's still time."</p> <p>Coglin glanced out at the dark, desolate fa?ades of the buildings.

"Me, too." </p> <p>Back at the precinct house, they parked the radio car in the garage, handed in their paperwork and went up to the locker room. It took Coglin less than ten minutes to put away the belt and gear, change out of his uniform, and exchange his service automatic for his off-duty .38.

"I don't know that. But I think I know what you were getting at. Don't worry about it."</p> <p>"You gonna be OK," Baker said with a grin, "or you want me to call the rubber-gun squad for you, maybe? Ask if they got any openings?"</p> <p>"You're a sensitive motherfucker," Coglin said, shaking his head with a slight smile. "I ever tell you that? A real warm individual. It's easy to share with you."</p> <p>Baker smiled widely.</p> <p>"Glad to see you're feeling better, partner," he said.</p> <p>"Shoo, shoo," Coglin told him as he rose. "Under a hedge."</p> <p>Coglin left the locker room, walked out through the musty stationhouse and crossed the street to his car. He turned the engine over and waited, letting it warm. He glanced at the precinct, its narrow windows still burning with their grim but steady yellow light. He backed out.</p> <p>He was passing under the elevated track on his way to the highway when he saw them: a group of teens -- a half dozen or more -- crowded in the roofed stairwell leading up to the El. At first, the older man in their midst seemed to be a friend of theirs, a concerned father maybe taking his son home. Then a forty-ounce malt liquor bottle crashed across the side of his head, and he buckled and fell. </p> <p>Coglin was out in the rain and running almost before his fishtailing car had stopped completely. He was less than twenty feet away and closing when they noticed him. Young, hooded bodies spilled over the black-painted stair rail, through the thin opening, up the stairs. He caught the last one out -- a squat, overweight punk -- with a slap that set him down on the pavement. The kid managed to push himself to his feet and then ran off.</p> <p>The victim was middle-aged and Hispanic. He was wearing a suit that was wet and soiled, and he raised his bloodied head with a moan. Coglin looked up the stairs in time to see the sneaker soles of one of the pack gain the top landing.

What a ripping read! It's like an invitation to the wildest party Greenwich Village ever saw. You feel swept up in the coffeehouse culture that transformed ordinary suburban kids into ragged, radiant avatars of a traditional yet bewilderingly new music. Hajdu's sociomusical analysis is as scholarly as (though less arty than) Greil Marcus's work; he deftly sketches the sources and evolving styles of his ambitious, rather calculating subjects, proving in the process that genius is not individual--it's rooted in a time and place. Hajdu says Dylan heisted many early tunes (e.g., "Maggie's Farm" from Pete Seeger's "Down on Penny's Farm"): "Dylan [told] a radio interviewer that he felt as if his music had always existed and he just wrote it down ... [in fact], much of his early work had existed as other writers' melodies, chord structures, or thematic ideas." But Dylan and company made it all their own, and Hajdu vividly evokes the scenes they made. <p> <i>Positively 4th Street</i> is very much a group portrait. When something amazing happens, Hajdu puts you right there. The unknown Baez barefoot in the rain, bedazzling the Newport Jazz Festival and becoming immortal overnight. The irresistibly irresponsible Fariï¿½a talking his folk-star wife out of shooting him dead with his own pistol. The "little spastic gnome" Dylan transmogrified into greatness onstage, bashing Joan with the searing lyrics of "She Belongs to Me." A stoned Fariï¿½a advising Dylan to cynically hitch his wagon to Joan's rising star and "start a whole new genre. Poetry set to music, but not chamber music or beatnik jazz, man... poetry you can dance to."</p><p> The book is as delectably gossipy as <i>Vanity Fair</i> (one of Hajdu's employers). Richard married the exceedingly young beauty Mimi and helmed their career, but he might have dumped her for big sister Joan, whose madcap humor and verbal wit harmonized with his--except that he ineptly killed himself on a motorcycle first. Bob mumblingly courted both sisters, but when he cruelly taunted the insecure Joan, Mimi yanked his hair back until he cried. The account of Bob and Joan's musical-erotic passion is first-rate music history and uproarious soap opera. Hajdu's research is prodigious--even Fariï¿½a's close chum Thomas Pynchon granted interviews--and his anecdotes are often off-the-cuff funny: "[Rock manager Albert Grossman] was easy to deal with.... It wasn't till maybe two days after you would see Albert that you'd realize your underwear had been stolen." Full disclosure: Hajdu was one of my long-ago bosses at <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, but that's certainly not why I heartily endorse this book. It's scholarship with a human face, akin to "poetry you can dance to." <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>David Hajdu is the author of <i>Lush Life: A Biography of Billy Strayhorn</i>.

Children make signs to ward off the evil eye whenever she passes. She suspects she is being followed. And in the dark crypt, where the bodies of the dead remain partially preserved, she feels the touch of a live hand.<br>A tragedy from the past still grips Loch Morag. But that is nothing compared to the evil in the present, when a sudden storm reveals murder -- and Sister Joan must abandon her solitude to ferret out a killer. . .Plucky and engaging Sister Joan, whose sleuthing was previously chronicled in A Vow of Silence and A Vow of Chastity , leaves her Cornwall convent for a month-long retreat in western Scotland. On excursions from her furnished cave, overlooking a beautiful loch and a nearby monastery which was originally a lookout post from which the natives hoped to spy maurauding Vikings, Joan is greeted with suspicion and hostility by the locals, who are mostly Calvinists. She also uncovers a number of mysteries to ponder when she is not praying. Why did Alasdair McKensie, a Catholic, disappear six years before? Did his wife kill him for having an affair with Catherine Sinclair, wife of the Protestant cleric? And was Catherine's death three months later a suicide or an accident? What of the nocturnal tryst of young Morag Sinclair with a cowled oarsman who could be the considerably older abbot of the monastery? After Joan observes modern shoes on one of the mummifed bodies of the supposedly ancient priests seated in a monastery crypt, the body disappears. Joan's bravery in battling a fierce freak tide leads to the recovery of that body and the unraveling of other puzzles. Her wit, true innocence, humility and joyous spirit win the admiration of villagers and readers alike.

In between it was switched back-and-forth between east and west depending on the crisis, and it fought in nearly every major campaign, from Barbarossa to Normandy, and from Kharkov to the Ardennes. <br><br>Das Reich was the first Waffen SS division created (though the title &#x201c;1st&#x201d; was reserved for Hitler&#x2019;s Leibstandarte). Originally named the Verfï¿½gungs Division, its regiments fought through the campaigns in Poland, the Low Countries, and France, earning the respect of Wehrmacht leaders who originally doubted the efficacy of SS units. Renamed &#x201c;Das Reich&#x201d; after the French surrender, its elements served as a spearhead in the Balkans campaign, achieving a daring capture of Belgrade.<br><br>In Operation Barbarossa, Das Reich fought with Guderian&#x2019;s Second Panzer Group, first in the drive on Moscow, then toward Kiev, then Moscow again. Pulled out of the line after gigantic casualties, it seized Toulon in France, then was sent back to Russia, as part of the SS Panzer Corps, to retrieve the German debacle after Stalingrad. At the titanic tank-battle of Kursk, Das Reich was at the forefront.<br><br>In June 1944, as a full SS-Panzer Division, Das Reich played an infamous role in its approach march to Normandy, as the French Resistance temporarily reached a high tide. On the Allied invasion front, Das Reich not only escaped from the Falaise Pocket but was sent back into it, to retrieve other German units struggling to get out.<br><br>Das Reich fought in the Battle of the Bulge, and was then transferred to Hungary, for Hitler&#x2019;s last counteroffensive of the war.

The Red Sox and the Cincinnati Reds have endured an excruciating three-day rain delay. Tonight, at last, they will play Game Six of the World Series. Leading three games to two, Cincinnati hopes to win it all; Boston is desperate to stay alive. But for all the anticipation, nobody could have predicted what a classic it would turn out to be: an extra-innings thriller, created by one of the Big Red Machine's patented comebacks and the Red Sox's improbable late-inning rally; clutch hitting, heart-stopping defensive plays, and more twists and turns than a Grand Prix circuit, climaxed by one of the most famous home runs in baseball history that ended it in the twelfth.<p>Here are all the inside stories of some of that era's biggest names in sports: Johnny Bench, Luis Tiant, Sparky Anderson, Pete Rose, Carl Yastrzemski-eight Hall of Famers in all-as well as sportscasters and network execs, cameramen, umpires, groundskeepers, politicians, and fans who gathered in Fenway that extraordinary night.</p><p><em>Game Six</em> is an unprecedented behind-the-scenes look at what is considered by many to be the greatest baseball game ever played--remarkable also because it was about so much more than just balls and strikes. This World Series marked the end of an era; baseball's reserve clause was about to be struck down, giving way to the birth of free agency, a watershed moment that changed American sports forever. In bestselling author Mark Frost's talented hands, the historical significance of Game Six becomes every bit as engrossing as its compelling human drama.</p><p>Praise for <em>The Match</em></p><p>"Mark Frost, author of one of the sport's all-time great books, The Greatest Game Ever Played, produces another wonderful telling of a true tale . . . in The Match."<br>--<em>Chicago Tribune</em></p><p>"Frost captures an elusive magic in this improbable matchup and what it meant for those who played and witnessed it."<br>--<em>Publishers Weekly</em></p><p>"It's difficult to beat a good golf book, be it a good yarn or a picture book . . . The golf is spectacular, the course more so, the descriptions luminous."<br>--<em>USA Today</em></p></p><p><strong>Mark Frost</strong> is the author of the critically acclaimed <em>The Greatest Game Ever Played</em>, <em>The Grand Slam</em>, and the bestselling <em>The List of 7</em>, <em>The 6 Messiahs</em>, and <em>Before I Wake</em>. He received a Writer's Guild Award and an Emmy nomination for his work as executive story editor on the acclaimed television series <em>Hill Street Blues</em>, and was the co-creator and executive producer of the ABC television series <em>Twin Peaks</em>. He lives in Los Angeles and upstate New York.Many a diehard baseball fan could tell you how Game 6 of the 1975 World Series ended&#x2014;with Boston catcher Carlton Fisk dramatically waving his extra-inning home run toward fair territory, and the pandemonium that soon followed. As for the other details, Frost (<i>The Match</i>) mentions them all in a wonderful tale about one of the sport's seminal events. Describing pitch by pitch and inning by inning, Frost breaks down the excitement on the field, but also how each participant came to play in the October thriller. Each player has a story&#x2014;from Boston's star pitcher Luis Tiant and his humble beginnings, to Cincinnati's rugged, trash-talking third baseman, Pete Rose. From Yastrzemski to Bench, Evans to Morgan, Frost covers them all, along with the managers, owners and even broadcasters, expertly weaving from the past to that famous fall night. The last third of the work covers the aftermath of the game, recapping Cincinnati's eventual World Series win in Game 7 (an oft-forgotten fact about that series), and what became of each player in the years following. With each passing baseball season, the number of people who would later claim to have been at Game Six would increase twenty-fold, and thanks to Frost, the reader will likewise feel like he was in attendance at Fenway Park for that World Series classic. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In a sweeping narrative, George Makari demonstrates how a new way of thinking about inner life coalesced and won followers who spread this body of thought throughout the West. Along the way he introduces the reader to a fascinating array of characters, many of whom have been long ignored or forgotten.</p><p>Amid great ferment, Sigmund Freud emerged as a creative, interdisciplinary thinker who devised a riveting new theory of the mind that attracted acolytes from the very fields the Viennese doctor had mined for his synthesis. These allies included Eugen Bleuler, Carl Jung, and Alfred Adler, all of whom eventually broke away and accused the Freudian community of being unscientific. Makari reveals how in the wake of these crises, innovators like Sï¿½ndor Ferenczi, Wilhelm Reich, Melanie Klein, and others reformed psychoanalysis, which began to gain wide acceptance only to be banished from the continent and sent into exile due to the rise of fascism.</p><p>Groundbreaking, insightful, and compulsively readable, <em>Revolution in Mind</em> goes beyond myth and polemic to give us the story of one of the most controversial intellectual endeavors of the twentieth century.</p></p><p><p>George Makari is director of Cornell's Institute for the History of Psychiatry, associate professor of psychiatry at Weill Medical College, adjunct associate professor at Rockefeller University, and a faculty member of Columbia University's Psychoanalytic Center. His writings on the history of psychoanalysis have won numerous awards. He lives in New York City</p>Makari, the director of Cornell's Institute for the History of Psychiatry, provides a comprehensive early history of psychoanalysis from 1895 to 1946. Although his early colleague Josef Breuer justifiably claimed that Freud was a man given to absolute and exclusive formulations, the great Viennese thinker's revolutionary understanding of the psyche evolved quite a bit, shifting away from psychosexual theory toward the tripartite division of the psyche (ego/id/superego) around 1920. Discussing the steadily growing community of psychoanalysts in Vienna (and, successively, in Zurich, Berlin and elsewhere), Makari notes that the Freudians could sometimes be intellectually insular and sectlike, resulting in the expulsion of Alfred Adler and C.G. Jung from Freud's circle between 1907 and 1913. Makari succinctly describes developments after Freud's influence peaked, especially the prominence of what came to be called ego psychology as developed by Heinz Hartmann, and the bitter intellectual dispute between Melanie Klein and Anna Freud. Makari tries to cover so much ground that some sections get a bit sketchy, but most of his ideas come across clearly in this challenging but rewarding intellectual history. 31 b&amp;w photos. <i>(Jan. 8)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Chu is consequently recruited by the Special Crimes Division of the FDA and forced to put one horrifically disgusting thing after another into his mouth. The setting is a near-future world where a pandemic bird flu has led the U.S. government to outlaw chicken (now served only at speakeasies), giving rise to the discovery of a suspicious fruit that tastes... like chicken. Though Layman's tone can be inconsistent--fluctuating between light comedy and grisly violence--it levels out when other characters with food-related gifts show up, including a "cibolocutor" who can express himself solely through culinary arts. Guillory's loose, loopy style, with its wildly distorted anatomy and perspective, underscores Layman's humor but is grounded in brick-solid storytelling; a knockout scene early on, where Chu becomes overwhelmed by the psychic residue in a single spoonful of soup, perfectly sums up the curious aftertaste of this nutty, tangy tome.

It is a moving and funny story of a boy growing into a man who then realizes he has only just begun to grow. <br><br>It is the story of turning points in Alda&#x2019;s life, events that would make him what he is&#x2013;if only he could survive them.<br><br>From the moment as a boy when his dead dog is returned from the taxidermist&#x2019;s shop with a hideous expression on his face, and he learns that death can&#x2019;t be undone, to the decades-long effort to find compassion for the mother he lived with but never knew, to his acceptance of his father, both personally and professionally, Alda learns the hard way that change, uncertainty, and transformation are what life is made of, and true happiness is found in embracing them.<br><br><b>Never Have Your Dog Stuffed</b>, filled with curiosity about nature, good humor, and honesty, is the crowning achievement of an actor, author, and director, but surprisingly, it is the story of a life more filled with turbulence and laughter than any Alda has ever played on the stage or screen.<b><br></b></p><p>Alan Alda's autobiography travels a path less taken. Instead of a sensationalist, name-dropping page-turner, Alda writes about his life as a memory play, an exercise in recollecting his childhood, his parents (dad Robert was a veteran on stage, film, and vaudeville), and his career. You want to know about Alda's most famous work, the eleven years on <i>M*A*S*H</i>? You have exactly 16 pages to do so, and guess what: It's one of the least entertaining parts of the book. But should fans of the award-winning actor-writer-director avoid this slim memoir? Not in the slightest. Slyly humorous and open-hearted, <i>Never Have Your Dog Stuffed</i> is a breezy, most enjoyable read. Alda's ability to recall his childhood (including backstage at raunchy vaudeville shows), school years, stage struggles and successes is as entertaining as one of his Emmy-winning teleplays. Alda is inordinately attune recalling life's crystallizing moments: when religion no longer worked for him, how something in his pocket made him forever a better actor, or his mother's painful descent into dementia. Alda's ever present humor is a great asset whether telling a charming love story on meeting his wife Arlene or a life-threatening illness in a remote part of Chile ("I am in and out of consciences, but I never take a break from the screaming. The show must go on."). Like Alda's persona, his book is more human and less flash. What would be filler in most books is often the mot entertaining and revealing here; especially Alda's dynamic relationship with his parents. Really, who else would name his memoir after an unfortunate trip to the taxidermist? The year the book was published during a revival for the 69-year-old; he was nominated for an Oscar, Emmy, and Tony in the same year. <i>--Doug Thomas</i>Alan Alda played Hawkeye Pierce for eleven years in the television series M*A*S*H and has acted in, written, and directed many feature films. He has starred often on Broadway, and his avid interest in science has led to his hosting PBS&#x2019;s Scientific American Frontiers for eleven years. He was nominated for an Academy Award in 2005 and has been nominated for thirty Emmy awards. He is married to the children&#x2019;s book author/photographer Arlene Alda.

The subject is Siddha Yoga, a path of meditation rooted in the Indian philosophical tradition that has had tremendous impact on contemporary students of spirituality since the 1970s. This book centers around the work of two teachers: Swami Muktananda, who introduced Siddha Yoga and its teachings to the West, inspiring what he termed a &#34;meditation revolution,&#34; and Gurumayi Chidvilasanada, who has brought Siddha Yoga Meditation to maturity as a global spiritual movement. This book examines one particular tradition in its historical and theological context, illuminating issues that will be of interest to serious students of religion and spirituality. From the Foreword: Paul Muller-Ortega, Douglas Renfrew Brooks, William K. Mahony, Swami Durgananda a.k.a. Sally Kempton, et. al., offer herein a rich feast of historical and theological reflection that is sympathetic to Siddha Yoga but at the same time is fully faithful to the canons of critical inquiry characteristic of serious history of religions work... One very much hopes that this collection may be the first of many other collections that dare to move away from purely descriptive scholarship in order to address some of the great spiritual issues of our time. This book&#39;s publisher, Muktabodha Indological Research Institute, is dedicated to the study, preservation, and dissemination of endangered elements of the ancient scriptural wisdom of India. The mission is propelled by a belief that the philosophical and spiritual heritage of classical India is a precious resource and a recognition of this wisdom as vital for the well-being of the human spirit.

When she writes about Salzburg and Brittany, you know she was there, noticing every detail, giving you a strong sense of place as individual as the place itself.

Although this year's selections tend to be intelligent and well written, there is a general lack of dramatic impact--seen at an extreme in Bruce Sterling's "Our Neural Chernobyl," about the bioengineering equivalent of computer hackers, a fascinating synopsis that never develops into a story. The pick of the volume introduces us to vividly imagined other worlds, for instance, what it is like to live on and inside a magically paralyzed mile-long dragon in Lucius Shepard's "The Scalehunter's Beautiful Daughter." Kim Stanley Robinson persuasively limns a boy's everyday life in a near-future Boston that is half overrun by a "Glacier." In "The Man Who Loved the Vampire Lady," Brian Stableford returns to the epic alternate history of his novel The Empire of Fear , wherein medieval Europe is ruled by an aristocracy of predatory creatures. Also among the 28 tales are works by Robert Silverberg, Connie Willis, Pat Cadigan and George Alec Effinger. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Seinfeldia: How a Show About Nothing Changed Everything</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Her book, as if she were a marine biologist, is a deep dive...Perhaps the highest praise I can give <i>Seinfeldia</i> is that it made me want to buy a loaf of marbled rye and start watching again, from the beginning.&#x201d; &#x2014;Dwight Garner, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><br> <br>The hilarious behind-the-scenes story of two guys who went out for coffee and dreamed up <i>Seinfeld</i>&#x2014;the cultural sensation that changed television and bled into the real world, altering the lives of everyone it touched.<br><br>Comedians Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld never thought anyone would watch their silly little sitcom about a New York comedian sitting around talking to his friends.

Seinfeld needed David&#x2019;s help with what could be the biggest opportunity of his career so far, and this turned out to be the perfect place to discuss it.<br> <br>They had come to Lee&#x2019;s Market on First Avenue and Seventy-Eighth Street, maybe for some snacks, maybe for material. The mundane tasks of life and comic gold often merged into one for them. Sure enough, they soon were making fun of the products they found among the fluorescent-lit aisles. Korean jelly, for instance: Why, exactly, did it have to come in a jelly form? Was there also, perhaps, a foam or a spray? The strange foods on the steam table: Who ate those? &#x201c;This is the kind of discussion you don&#x2019;t see on TV,&#x201d; David said.<br> <br>Seinfeld had told David a bit of news over the course of the evening: NBC was interested in doing a show with him. Some executive had brought him in for a meeting and everything. Seinfeld didn&#x2019;t have any ideas for television. He just wanted to be himself and do his comedy. He felt David might be a good brainstorming partner.<br> <br>Seinfeld and David had a common sensibility, in part because of their similar backgrounds: Both had grown up in the New York area and were raised Jewish. Both seized on observational humor for their acts. They had their differences, too, that balanced each other nicely: Seinfeld was thirty-four and on the rise thanks to his genial, inoffensive approach to comedy and his intense drive to succeed. David was far more caustic and sensitive to the slightest audience infractions (not listening, not laughing at the right moments, not laughing enough). He was older, forty-one, and struggling on the stand-up circuit because of his propensity to antagonize his audiences out of a rather explosive brand of insecurity.<br> <br>Seinfeld had dark hair blown dry into the classic &#x2019;80s pouf, while David maintained a magnificent Jew-fro, dented a bit in the middle by his receding hairline. Seinfeld&#x2019;s delivery often ascended to a high-pitched warble; David favored a guttural grumble that could become a yell without warning.<br> <br>They&#x2019;d first become friends in the bar of Catch a Rising Star in the late &#x2019;70s when Seinfeld started out as a comic. From then on, they couldn&#x2019;t stop talking. They loved to fixate on tiny life annoyances, in their conversations and their comedy. Soon they started helping each other with their acts and became friendly outside of work.<br> <br>Seinfeld had gotten big laughs by reading David&#x2019;s stand-up material at a birthday party for mutual friend Carol Leifer&#x2014;one of the few women among their band (or any band) of New York comedians. David, nearly broke, had given Leifer some jokes as a birthday &#x201c;gift.&#x201d; Too drunk to read them aloud, she handed them off to Seinfeld; he killed, which suggested some creative potential between the two men.<br> <br>As a result, it made sense for Seinfeld to approach David with this TV &#x201c;problem&#x201d; he now had. David also remained the only &#x201c;writer&#x201d; Seinfeld knew, someone who had, as Seinfeld said, &#x201c;actually typed something out on a piece of paper&#x201d; when he churned out bits for sketch shows like Fridays and Saturday Night Live.<br> <br>Seinfeld was smart to consult David on this TV thing. David did have a vision, if not a particularly grand one. &#x201c;This,&#x201d; David said as they bantered in Lee&#x2019;s Market, &#x201c;is what the show should be.&#x201d; Seinfeld was intrigued.<br> <br>The next night, after their comedy sets at the Improv in Midtown, David and Seinfeld went to the Westway Diner around the corner, at Forty-Fourth Street and Ninth Avenue. At about midnight, they settled into a booth and riffed on the possibilities: What about a special that simply depicted where comics get their material? Jerry could play himself in that, for sure. Cameras could document him going through his day, having conversations like the one at the market the night before; he&#x2019;d later put those insights into his act, which audiences would see at the end of the special. As they brainstormed, Seinfeld had one cup of coffee, then two. He usually didn&#x2019;t drink coffee at all. They were onto something.<br> <br>Seinfeld liked the idea enough to take it to NBC. The network signed off on it, suggesting a ninety-minute special called Seinfeld&#x2019;s Stand-Up Diary that would air in Saturday Night Live&#x2019;s time slot during an off week. As he thought about it, though, Seinfeld worried about filling an entire ninety minutes; thirty minutes, on the other hand, he could do.<br> <br>By the time he and David had written a thirty-minute script, in February 1989, they realized they had a sitcom on their hands instead of a special. Jerry and a Larry-like guy could serve as the two main characters, who would discuss the minutiae of their lives and turn it into comedy&#x2014;like Harold Pinter or Samuel Beckett for television. &#x201c;Two guys talking,&#x201d; Seinfeld said. &#x201c;This was the idea.&#x201d;<br> <br>To that setup, they added a neighbor. David told Seinfeld about his own eccentric neighbor, Kenny Kramer&#x2014;a jobless schemer with whom David shared a car, a TV, and one pair of black slacks in case either had a special occasion. He would be the basis for the third character. They set the first scene in a fictional coffee shop like the one where they&#x2019;d hatched their idea, and called it Pete&#x2019;s Luncheonette.<br> <br><br> <br>SEINFELDIA&#x2019;S FOUNDING FATHER AND NAMESAKE got his first inkling that he was funny at age eight. Little Jerry Seinfeld was sitting on a stoop with a friend in his middle-class town on Long Island, eating milk and cookies. Jerry&#x2014;usually a dorky, shy kid&#x2014;said something funny enough to cause his friend to spit milk and cookies back into Jerry&#x2019;s face and hair. Jerry thought, I would like to do this professionally.<br> <br>Seinfeld was born in Brooklyn but grew up in Massapequa. He spent his childhood watching Laugh-In, Batman, The Honeymooners, and Get Smart. (&#x201c;When I heard that they were going to do a sitcom with a secret agent who was funny, the back of my head blew off,&#x201d; he later said.) His parents, Betty and Kal, made humor a priority in their home. His father, a sign merchant, told jokes often. Even his business&#x2019;s name was a joke: Kal Signfeld Signs.<br> <br>As Jerry came into his own sense of humor, his performances grew more elaborate than mere jokes on the stoop. At Birch Lane Elementary School, he planned and starred in a skit for a class fair with his friend Lawrence McCue. Jerry played President Kennedy, and Lawrence played a reporter who asked him questions&#x2014;essentially, set up his jokes. They were the only ones at the fair who did a comedy routine. When Jerry graduated to Massapequa High School in 1968, he grew obsessed with two things: cars and the comedian Bill Cosby. He dabbled in acting, playing Julius Caesar in his tenth-grade English class. But comedy remained his focus. He saw even geometry class as training for comedy; a good joke, he felt, had the same rigorous internal logic as a theorem proof. The only difference was the silly twist at the end of a joke.<br> <br>When a long-haired Jerry Seinfeld attended Queens College, he acted in school productions and hung around the New York comedy clubs, wearing white sneakers like his idols Joe Namath and Cosby (circa the comedian&#x2019;s time on the &#x2019;60s show I Spy). As he waited to get up the nerve to pursue stand-up as a profession, he used his attendance at Manhattan comedy clubs as a kind of independent study. He analyzed comics&#x2019; approach to their material and even wrote a forty-page paper on the subject.<br> <br>He started to know the players: He eavesdropped, for instance, on Larry David talking to another comedian. David happened to be leaning on Seinfeld&#x2019;s car, a 1973 Fiat 128 SL, in front of the Improv one day in 1975, the first time Seinfeld ever saw his future writing partner. Seinfeld was impressed with these guys&#x2019; dedication to the profession. He didn&#x2019;t dare speak to them yet.<br> <br>After he graduated in 1976 as an honor student, Seinfeld applied his sense of discipline to becoming a stand-up, approaching it methodically. His first appearance on a professional stage as a comedian was at Catch a Rising Star in 1976, at age twenty-two. He&#x2019;d practiced his routine with a bar of soap until he had every word memorized. Comedian Elayne Boosler introduced him, and he took the stage. Once he got there, though, he couldn&#x2019;t remember a word. He stood there for several long seconds, not saying a thing. Finally, he remembered the subjects he&#x2019;d planned to talk about, so, without anything else to say, he listed them to the audience: &#x201c;the beach, driving, parents.&#x201d; People laughed, thinking this was his act, some high-concept performance art. Eventually he managed to fill three minutes with bits of material until he escaped the spotlight.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Jerry Seinfeld,&#x201d; Boosler quipped to the audience when it ended, &#x201c;the king of the segue.&#x201d;<br> <br>For four years, Seinfeld walked around the city night after night to hit clubs. He&#x2019;d go eighteen months in a row without one night off. He tape-recorded his routines, then analyzed them to improve by the next night. He also fell in love with The Mary Tyler Moore Show, which became a favorite among New York City comics in the &#x2019;80s because its syndicated reruns aired after Late Night with David Letterman, dovetailing with the time they got home from work. They talked about the previous night&#x2019;s episode when they saw one another at clubs, sometimes making dirty jokes about Mary and Rhoda.<br> <br>In 1979, after three years on the circuit, Seinfeld got what could have been a big break. He was cast as a recurring character on the hit sitcom Benson, a mail delivery guy named Frankie who did comedy routines no one wanted to hear. (The five-foot-eleven-inch comedian would bound into Benson&#x2019;s living-room set with an attempted catchphrase: &#x201c;Give a cheer, Frankie&#x2019;s here!&#x201d;) After three episodes, however, he showed up for a read-through and found no script waiting with his name on it. When he asked what was going on, an assistant director pulled him aside to tell him: He&#x2019;d been fired.<br> <br>Still, by the early &#x2019;80s, Seinfeld was secure in his position on the comedy circuit. He knew his brand. As he told teenage interviewer Judd Apatow, who hosted a show called Club Comedy on the Syosset High School radio station on Long Island, it took time to develop the skills that led to great observational jokes. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s one thing to see something,&#x201d; Seinfeld said, &#x201c;and another thing to do something with it.&#x201d;<br> <br>He would start with something that struck him as funny&#x2014;it could be something as small as a silly word&#x2014;and then work on it until he conveyed what he found so funny about it to his audience. The first line of a joke always had to be funny. Then he went from there, from funny thought to funny thought with the fewest possible unfunny thoughts in between, until it got to the absolute biggest laugh at the end. He was focused only on making people laugh, nothing else. &#x201c;Funny is the world I live in,&#x201d; he later said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re funny, I&#x2019;m interested. You&#x2019;re not funny, I&#x2019;m not interested.&#x201d;<br> <br>By the time he chatted with young Apatow in the early &#x2019;80s, he was playing clubs in New York, Atlantic City, and elsewhere. Apatow asked him, &#x201c;Where do you go from here? How much farther can you get?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a lot you can do,&#x201d; Seinfeld said. &#x201c;You can do a sitcom, which is something a lot of people don&#x2019;t want to be associated with. I&#x2019;m going to do some acting. But stand-up is what I am. The acting will be to improve my visibility.&#x201d; When Apatow asked what &#x201c;success&#x201d; meant to Seinfeld, the comedian had a clear and simple answer: &#x201c;To be considered one of the best stand-up comics.&#x201d;<br> <br>Around the same time as his interview with Apatow, Seinfeld hit the big time: his first appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in 1981. For him it was &#x201c;the Olympics, the Super Bowl, and the World Series all rolled into one,&#x201d; he later said. He edited his usual twenty-minute set down to its best five minutes, then practiced it at clubs five or six times a night, repeating it probably two hundred times before his big debut. He jogged to get into top physical condition. He played tapes of the Superman theme to psych himself up.<br> <br>Kal Seinfeld made a sign that he placed on his van the week before his son&#x2019;s appearance. In black letters over orange and green paint, it said: JERRY SEINFELD OF MASSAPEQUA WILL BE ON CARSON SPECIAL. Kal also took out an ad in the local paper to announce the occasion.<br> <br>The actual performance flew by for Jerry like a downhill roller coaster. He riffed on complex turn lanes, the 1,400-pound man in The Guinness Book of World Records, and weather reports: &#x201c;They show you the satellite photo. This is real helpful, a photograph of the earth from ten thousand miles away. Can you tell if you should take a sweater or not from that shot?&#x201d; Better yet, he earned laughs in all the right places, some spontaneous applause, and an &#x201c;OK&#x201d; sign from Carson himself.<br> <br>The appearance would lead to several more on Carson&#x2019;s show as well as Late Night with David Letterman. Seinfeld later called being on Carson &#x201c;the difference between thinking you&#x2019;re a comedian and really being one.&#x201d; Seinfeld would not have to do any more embarrassing bit parts on sitcoms.<br> <br>In 1984, though, he did go back to acting, as he&#x2019;d predicted when speaking to Apatow. This time, his prospects looked a little better. There he was, a lanky young man with a whoosh of dark hair, slick as ever in a black suit, black tie, and white shirt as he sat behind a network-executive desk in a Showtime movie that satirized the TV business, The Ratings Game. &#x201c;The networks aren&#x2019;t buying Italians, Jews, Puerto Ricans this season,&#x201d; he says as he swigs milk and eats chocolate cookies. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re buying gays, alcoholics, child molesters.&#x201d;<br> <br>A few years later came one more chance in television. In 1988, a new production company named Castle Rock considered casting Seinfeld in a sitcom pilot called Past Imperfect for ABC. Ultimately, the network rejected him because of his lack of acting experience, and the part went to another stand-up, Howie Mandel, but the pilot never aired.<br> <br>Seinfeld segued back into full-time stand-up, doing up to three hundred appearances per year across the country. He had regular spots on The Tonight Show. He had a comfortable life and didn&#x2019;t seem concerned with fame.<br> <br>As it turned out, however, those last two experiences in television&#x2014;his Showtime role and his almost-pilot&#x2014;were prophetic. The Ratings Game included Seinfeld&#x2019;s future Seinfeld costar, Michael Richards; Seinfeld&#x2019;s line anticipated how NBC executives would later object to his own sitcom creation&#x2014;the part about the Jews, at least. And his relationship with Castle Rock would prove critical when it came time to produce his own sitcom.<br> <br><br> <br>LARRY DAVID WAS WHAT&#x2019;S KNOWN as a comic&#x2019;s comic, an acquired taste, &#x201c;which mea...</p><h2>Ranches: Design Ideas for Renovating, Remodeling, and Building New (Updating Classic America)</h2><p><p>Transform an ordinary ranch into the home youve always wanted with <i><strong>Ranches</strong>,</i> the latest entry in Taunton's acclaimed Updating Classic America series. <br><br> The ranch can be found everywhere on both coasts and in Americas heartland too.

Developed in conjunction with the American Museum of Natural History, this nonfiction picture book follows a dolphin from birth as he swims with his mom; learns to eat, jump, and play with his pod; and even escapes a shark.&nbsp;With its beautiful ocean photography and fun dolphin facts, this sweet story will make a splash with any young reader.</p><p>The American Museum of Natural History in New York City is one of the largest and most respected museums in the world. Since the Museum was founded in 1869, its collections have grown to include more than 33 million specimens and artifacts relating to the natural world and human cultures. The Museum showcases its collections in the exhibit halls and, behind the scenes, more than 200 scientists carry out cutting-edge research. It is also home to the Hayden Planetarium, which enjoys a proud legacy that has blended scientific scholarship with innovative public outreach for much of the past century. Approximately five million people from around the world visit the Museum each year. Plan a trip to the Museum, home of the world&#39;s largest collection of dinosaur fossils, or visit online at amnh.org.Stunning photographs and descriptive, engaging prose depict a day in the life of a baby dolphin and its mother. Readers will learn about the calf&#x2019;s environment, eating habits, communication, and family dynamic. The information, provided by the American Museum of Natural History, is comprehensive enough to serve as a research resource, while the text is simple enough to work well as a read-aloud for younger students. Most pages are composed of large photographs with a block of text on a colored background. Some of the vocabulary, such as the words danger and splash, is in a bigger, more playful font than the rest of the text. The work ends with the sun setting over the dolphins arcing above the water: &#x201c;Tomorrow will be another adventure.&#x201d; One missing element is back matter. ï¿½VERDICT A welcome addition to any elementary school&#x2019;s ocean mammal collection&#x2014;libraries can&#x2019;t go wrong with dolphins! (<i>School Library Journal</i>)<br><br>This large-format picture book introduces a baby dolphin shortly after birth. The lightly fictionalized narrative describes his first day of life, from his mother nudging him to the surface for his first breath to the closing scene that shows dolphins jumping into the air, silhouetted against the sunset. In between events such as nursing, swimming with the pod, naptime, and the sudden, alarming appearance of a shark, the informative text delivers basic, interesting facts about dolphin anatomy and behavior in the wild, with particular emphasis on calves. The presentation is direct, simple, and uncluttered. Each double-page spread features one, two, or three color photos, which vary in size and position. While the photos were chosen from 20 sources, the dolphins look similar enough, particularly in the many underwater scenes, that the use of different animals isn&#x2019;t noticeable. A good addition to science collections, this is one that young dolphin fans will enjoy. Simultaneously published, <i>Wolf Pups Join the Pack</i> looks at another popular wild animal.

Nathanson worked for newspapers and magazines in New York, Los Angeles and Washington D.C. His novel The Dirty Dozen became a hugely successful motion picture. He now lives in South Laguna, California.This surprisingly rich sequel to Nathanson's The Dirty Dozen begins with OSS Maj. John Reisman switching from the European to the Pacific theater and parachuting into Burma to try to prevent conflict between two of America's allies, the Kachin tribesmen and the Kuomintang of bordering China. Conflicts and the peculiarly shifting Asian alliances comprise this book's themespolitics that, as history shows, resulted in still more turmoil in postwar Asia. Reisman's assignment leads him from Burma to China, where he learns of treachery among warlords and secret collaboration with the Japanese. Then it takes him to Vietnam and an unusual arrangement with the young Ho Chi Minh. In addition to action a-plenty, the narrative contains richly textured portrayals of the intersecting cultures and the sophisticated relationship of politics to this (or any) war.

Surrounded by two-feet snow banks, the ice above crystal clear waters invited daring souls with a siren song of beauty. . . and treachery. Trained rescue people know a frozen mountain lake is the most illusive of natural phenomena. There is no such thing as "safe ice." It could be two to four feet dense in one place, but only a short distance away, pockets of warm springs bubbling under the surface might shrivel the thickness to a perilous few inches.<p></p> On a cloudless day in February, fifteen teenagers and two counselors from Camp O&#x2019;Neal, a residential facility for troubled youth, were on a holiday outing at the lake. What began as an adventure ended in disaster.<p></p> Some of the boys stayed with Counselor Randy Porter on the breakwater by the marina, throwing rocks to break the shallow-water ice. Another group was about eight feet out on the ice, laughing and clowning around while Counselor Dave Meyers snapped pictures. At first no one noticed five boys who were headed toward the middle of the lake. When Randy spotted them, they were already far out from shore.<p></p> "Hey, you guys . . . get back here. It&#x2019;s dangerous out there!" His shouts fell on deaf ears.<p></p> Far out on the frozen lake, the boys heard a loud crack and looked down to see the ice fracturing beneath them. One boy shouted, "We shouldn&#x2019;t be doing this," and started back to shore. The other four boys forged ahead.<p></p> "I don&#x2019;t care if I die!" one boy shouted as he smashed the ice with his hiking boots.<p></p> Within seconds, the four boys fell into the freezing water as the loud crack of the ice fracture echoed through the canyon. Muffled screams coming from the middle of the lake could be heard on shore. Counselor Dave dropped his camera gear and began to race toward the sound of those frantic cries. With each step the ice gave way under his feet.<p></p> When Counselor Randy realized the danger, he immediately ordered the kids close to shore to get off the ice and instructed one of the wards to run to the ranger&#x2019;s residence for help. Then Randy headed out on the ice himself.<p></p> Dave reached the spot where the four boys had been hanging onto the edge of the ice, but only three were there. Shawn was gone. Without a wet suit, Dave&#x2019;s jeans and sweatshirt were frozen stiff, but he plunged into the ice-water and pushed Phil to the surface and coached him to crawl on his belly to the north shore, some two hundred feet away. Phil survived, but his buddy, Sellars, was unable to move, his body frozen to the surface of the ice. Dave and another boy, Ryan, struggled for life as hypothermia gripped their bodies.<p></p> On shore, Ranger Clay Cutter, caretaker for Convict Lake, had been called from his home by a hysterical boy. His wife, Teri, dialed 911 and reported to the emergency services dispatcher that four youths were "through the ice at Convict Lake." She told her three daughters, "Stay in the house," grabbed her binoculars, and headed to the lake that was consuming the lives of those caught in its freezing grip. She watched the entire event, including the valiant life-and-death battle her husband fought for the next forty-five minutes.<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> MOUNTAIN RESCUE TEAM In a mountain home twenty-five miles from Convict Lake, the beeper sounded for Reverend Russ Veenker, a man trained in underwater search and recovery and a skilled scuba diver. A few moments before two of his friends, Doug Englekirk and Doug Nidevar, expert athletes themselves, had stopped to visit the Veenker family and hearing the urgent call, asked, "Can we help?"<p></p> While Kandy Veenker rushed to the phone to alert other rescue team members, Russ paused for a quick prayer. "Lord . . . keep us safe." Prayer was SOP&#x2013;Standard Operating Procedure&#x2013;for Russ. He always prayed for the safety of the rescuers because many times they risked their own lives to save others. He knew that life-and-death situations were in God&#x2019;s hands.<p></p> "Get the rubber life raft and meet me at the lake," Russ instructed the two Dougs.<p></p> He gave Kandy a quick kiss and hug. "Love you." This was also SOP.<p></p> Kandy had great confidence in Russ&#x2019;s wilderness abilities and God&#x2019;s protection. But this time as he pulled out of the driveway, she felt oppressed by a vague presence of darkness. She began to pray more fervently.<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> FROM FEAR TO PANIC Ranger Clay Cutter and Counselor Randy Porter watched helplessly as one boy slipped away under the surface. As they were moving on their hands and knees toward the large ice hole where another boy and Counselor Dave Meyers were struggling to keep their heads above water, suddenly the entire edge of the hole cracked and gave way. Randy fell into the water just as Clay&#x2019;s frozen hand lost its grip on Sellars. Convict Lake had claimed two victims.<p></p> On shore, emergency units had arrived and begun a rescue effort. Paramedic Chris Baitx and Fire Captains Vidar Anderson and Ray Turner obtained an aluminum fishing boat and began to push over the ice toward the hole. However, the thin layer gave way from the weight, spilling Captain Turner overboard. Baitx and Anderson rescued him before he sank below the surface. While this drama was being played, far out on the ice a frantic voice was heard.<p></p> "Hurry up!" screamed Ranger Cutter.<p></p> Paramedic Baitx retrieved a ladder from the boat and, tying one end of a rope to himself and the other to the ladder, grabbed a pike pole and, pushing the ladder ahead of him like a sled, crawled over the ice toward the victims.<p></p> At the ice hole, Baitx saw Counselor Randy and one of the boys holding to the end of a rope and Counselor Dave floating on his back a short distance away. Baitx headed toward Dave, but the ladder he was using for support turned into a slick slide and plunged him into the water.<p></p> Meanwhile, Captain Anderson, using two ladders like giant snowshoes, was sliding across the surface of the ice in another rescue attempt.<p></p> Then Dave disappeared. One more fatality. How many more lives would be claimed before this nightmare ended?<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> BEFORE IT&#x2019;S TOO LATE When Russ arrived on the scene he was not prepared for what he saw. There were a dozen or more fire volunteers standing on the breakwater looking at a couple of stick figures kneeling on the ice in the middle of the lake. They were Ranger Cutter and Captain Anderson, but no one on the shore could tell who they were.<p></p> Those on land were powerless. They could hear cries for help, but the voices were fading. When fire and rescue personnel are put in a situation they can&#x2019;t fix, it&#x2019;s like telling a small child to push a full-size cement truck around the block. Frustration turned to despair.<p></p> "How many out there?" Russ asked.<p></p> "We&#x2019;re not sure. We think three or four kids, a couple of counselors, Ranger Cutter, Captain Anderson, and Paramedic Baitx. . . . We don&#x2019;t have any communication with them."<p></p> Russ knew he had thirty to sixty minutes in thirty-four degree water with his wet suit on to go into the ice water hole and push as many victims as possible to the surface.<p></p> He started out onto the ice, but was confronted with stark reality. Spider fractures were breaking out around his feet with every step. <i>Lord, nobody should be out here.</i> He dropped on his belly and began to crawl along the rope that was being held on shore and attached to someone out on the ice. His wet suit constricted body movement; it was like running a mile with manacles on your ankles.<p></p> Suddenly there was a muffled sound of splashing and yelling&#x2013;the rope under Russ was being pulled toward shore. Baitx was being dragged through the razor sharp ice as the skin on his body ripped into bloody shreds. Behind him were three, apparently alive, victims in the water.<p></p> <i>There are four of them, and only one of me,</i> Russ thought. Terror moved through his body like a lightning bolt, <i>Lord, help me!</i><p></p> He was about twenty feet from Baitx. Russ turned toward shore and with all of his might shouted, "Stop pulling the rope!" When he looked around, he could no longer see Counselor Randy.<p></p> In quick succession, Captain Anderson succumbed to the icy depths, only six feet from Russ&#x2019;s outstretched hand. He could still hear Ranger Cutter yelling for help about one hundred feet away.<p></p> <i>Lord, this can&#x2019;t be happening!</i> Russ cried out under his breath. By now Paramedic Baitx was submerged under the ice, but Russ plunged below him and pushed him to the surface.<p></p> "It&#x2019;s okay, buddy. . . . This is Russ. I&#x2019;ve got you. My wetsuit is buoyant."<p></p> Baitx moaned. He was still alive. However, the rope that was tied to his waist was also fastened to a fourteen foot fire ladder, which was pulling him down. Russ dove under water to see if he could free Baitx from the ladder, but discovered the rope was wrapped around the paramedic&#x2019;s legs like a tangled mesh of fishing line.<p></p> "Russ," Baitx murmured through purple lips. "I can&#x2019;t make it . . . tell my wife . . ."<p></p> "We&#x2019;ll make it . . . hang in there." Russ answered calmly, but fear gripped him.<p></p> As the possibility of survival waned, the two Dougs arrived, sliding through the broken ice with a life raft. Later Russ realized that it was no accident that the Lord sent those men at that moment to play a vital, life-saving role.<p></p> After unloosening the rope from Baitx&#x2019;s legs, they lifted him onto the raft and pushed to shore. Russ began to swim in the direction of the voice he had heard calling for help, but after a few strokes, he realized that nobody was there. All he could see was a jacket, a few gloves, and a couple of wool caps sitting on the surface.<p></p> Convict Lake had claimed its seventh victim, Ranger Clay Cutter.<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> TRAUMA ON SHORE Baitx was rushed to the emergency hospital by members of his own paramedic team. When his gurney was pushed through the double emergency door, a shocked and horrified nurse, Lori Baitx, looked down at the battered, nearly frozen body of her husband.<p></p> After the ambulance left the lake, the crowd on shore began to realize what had happened. "Where&#x2019;s Vidar? . . . Where&#x2019;s Clay? Did you see Randy or Dave out there? What about the boys?" The horror of reality set in. Teri Cutter was in shock. She had watched her husband fight for life until the very end.<p></p> Russ fell on his knees in the snow. He was too emotionally spent to stand. He heard his radio "cackling" in the background with the report, "We have seven confirmed fatalities . . . four, I think, were rescuers."<p></p> Because one man had the proper equipment, another man&#x2019;s life was saved. Tragically, because warnings were ignored on that fateful day, it was too late for the seven who plunged to their freezing death on the lake that was rightly named. It was, indeed, a brutal convict.<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> WILL WE LISTEN? The warnings are posted today. <b>THIN ICE AHEAD.</b> Our eternal destiny is determined by whether we heed the signs or ignore them. Rescuers may want to save us, but it could be too late.<p></p> The final days for all of the inhabitants of planet earth have been recorded for almost two thousand years. In our time, those signs are becoming closer and bolder.<p></p> The decade of the nineties has seen tremendous changes in the world. The high-decibel threats of communism have become less threatening as governments have toppled and new leaders have emerged. Many oppressed people have experienced a freedom they had never known.<p></p> <i>Time</i> magazine had a cover story showing the heads of the world&#x2019;s two most powerful countries smiling at each other over the words, "Building a New World."<p></p> Although we may rejoice that old animosities are dissolving and experience new hope for peace in the world community, at the same time we suspect that we are being lulled into a false security.<p></p> Warnings have been posted about dangers ahead. We can either watch and listen or ignore them.<p></p> The signs of the time are on a fast track, pointing to the final days of Bible prophecy. It&#x2019;s true that many people shrug their shoulders and say, "Is this like the guy who said the end of the world would come on September 16, 1988? Come on now! I&#x2019;ve heard this stuff before."<p></p> The apostle Peter said: "First, I want to remind you that in the last days there will come scoffers who will do every wrong they can think of, and laugh at the truth. This will be their line of argument: &#x2018;So Jesus promised to come back, did he? Then where is he? He&#x2019;ll never come! Why, as far back as anyone can remember everything has remained exactly as it was since the first day of creation&#x2019;" (2 Peter 3:3&#x2014;4, tlb).<p></p> There is a book in the Bible that scoffers should read. It contains warnings far more solemn than those directed at the young men on Convict Lake.<p></p> The Book of Revelation predicts the climax of the ages and the sequence of events leading up to the return of Jesus Christ. Furthermore, this book explains where every person will be for all eternity.<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> WHO CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE? When someone asks me, "When is your birthday?" I become wary. I don&#x2019;t believe they plan to send me a present. They probably want to know what sign I live under so they can tell me how to run my life. In spite of the nonsense of astrological predictions, most of the major newspapers in the country continue to carry these columns, and many people use these silly predictions to determine how they will plan their daily activities and future goals. Even people who are prominent in public life consult astrologers and psychics, searching for answers to life&#x2019;s complexities.<p></p> God predicts the future with inerrant accuracy. He knows the end from the beginning. However, He gives us the guide for the present. "Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own" (Matthew 6:34).<p></p> We are not to worry about tomorrow, but He wants us to understand the future so we will know how to live <i>today.</i> His Book is filled with predictions that have already been fulfilled. Look at just a few of them.<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p> TRUE TO DATE In the Old Testament there are more than 300 references to the coming Messiah that were fulfilled in Jesus Christ. In Genesis 3:15 we find the first reference to the fact that the Savior of the world would be born of "the seed of the woman" (kjv). This ancient promise predicts a struggle between Israel&#x2019;s Messiah and Satan, and it foretells the Messiah&#x2019;s eventual victory.<p></p> The prophet Isaiah tells that the Messiah will be born of a virgin. It was prophesied that He would be the Son of God and that He would trace His humanity to Abraham, father of the Jewish nation. He would come from the tribe of Judah and the house of David. Micah foretold that He would be born in Bethlehem and the psalmist wrote that He shall be called Lord.1<p></p> It was predicted that the coming Messiah would be a prophet, a judge, and a king. This Man whom the Jews were waiting for (and many are still seeking) would be more than an ordinary human being, for the Spirit of the Lord would give Him wisdom and knowledge beyond our comprehension.2<p></p> To me, prophecy is the most absorbing study in the Bible. The coming Messiah&#x2019;s...</p><h2>One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish (Beginner Books(R))</h2><p><p>&#x201c;From there to here, from here to there, funny things are everywhere&#x201d; . . .

While many rhymes in this couplet collection resemble sphinx-worthy riddles, Seuss's intention is clear: teach children to read in a way that is both entertaining and educational. It matters little that each wonderful vignette has nothing to do with the one that follows. (We move seamlessly from a one-humped Wump and Mister Gump to yellow pets called the Zeds with one hair upon their heads.)

She went on after that with a similar project for adults, completing a clear three-volume edition of Dantes DIVINE COMEDY in contemporary English prose. <p>Although Lindskoog has published a variety of original books for adults, she has never outgrown her earliest book- love of all -- childrens literature. Her first book, THE LION OF JUDAH IN NEVER-NEVER LAND (written in 1957 and republished in its fourth edition in 1997) was about C. S. Lewiss Narnian Chronicles. Her book about the whole spectrum of childrens literature, titled HOW TO GROW A YOUNG READER, was first published in 1978 and is being released in its third edition in 1999. So her entire career as an author, 1957-1999 is bracketed by her two books about books for children. </p><p>Lindskoog is a resident of Orange, California, where she and her husband John enjoyed raising and reading to their own children.</p>George MacDonald's 1870s' Sir Gibbie, about a destitute Scottish orphan, was reportedly a favorite of C.S. Lewis's. An edition of the novel, prepared by Kathryn Lindskoog, inaugurates a Classics for Young Readers series, while a companion, Sir Gibbie: A Guide for Teachers and Students by Ranelda Mack Hunsicker, is available for teachers, students and home-schoolers. In the Guide, Hunsicker contends that Sir Gibbie served as a source for Huckleberry Finn, although Mark Twain (a friend of MacDonald's) upended MacDonald's religious message. Noting that previous editions of Gibbie "cut out much of MacDonald's Christian teaching," Hunsicker adds that Lindskoog's goal was "to restore [the book] to its original Christ-centered plot." <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Winning the Discipline Debates: Dr. Ray Coaches Parents to Make Discipline Less Frequent, Less Frustrating, and More Consistent</h2><p><i>Winning the Discipline Debates</i> covers a series of the most common (and most frustrating) discipline scenarios between parents and kids.

Irving, a renowned obstetrician and gynecologist, and includes Mr. Irving's incisive history of abortion politics in the United States. But <b>My Movie Business</b> focuses primarily on the thirteen years John Irving spent adapting his novel <i>The Cider House Rules</i> for the screen--for four different directors.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Mr. Irving also writes about the failed effort to make his first novel, <i>Setting Free the Bears</i>, into a movie; about two of the films that were made from his novels (but not from his screenplays), <i>The World According to Garp</i> and <i>The Hotel New Hampshire</i>; about his slow progress at shepherding his screenplay of <i>A Son of the Circus</i> into production.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Not least, and in addition to its qualities as a memoir--anecdotal, comic, affectionate, and candid--My Movie Business is an insightful essay on the essential differences between writing a novel and writing a screenplay.<br><br>The photographs in <b>My Movie Business</b> were taken by Stephen Vaughan, the still photographer on the set of The Cider House Rules--a Miramax production directed by Lasse Hallstrï¿½m, with Michael Caine in the role of Dr. Larch. Concurrently with the November 1999 release of the film, Talk Miramax Books will publish John Irving's screenplay.</p><p>John Irving's novels pose tantalizing challenges to filmmakers: at his best, Irving has proven both popular and ambitious, crafting rich, picaresque fiction that juggles Big Themes and antic comedy, braiding his central narratives with intriguing subplots and discursive back stories driven by vivid characters. Irving's accessibility teases the would-be director or producer with the prospect of commercial acceptance even as the scope and intricacy of his work raises crucial risks for the scriptwriter. With two early novels that made it to the screen, <i>The World According to Garp</i> and <i>The Hotel New Hampshire</i>, Irving's box office impact thus far evenly translates to hit and miss.<p> This slender memoir offers a perceptive, if hardly objective, critique of the inherent differences between novels and screenplays, with the writer sharing his own experiences creating both. Irving focuses principally on his crusade to bring <i>The Cider House Rules</i> to the screen, tracing its gestation through four successive directors; with Irving himself attached as scriptwriter, we see the novelist struggling to reconcile the demands of concision against his paternal instincts toward the original book. Written before the final cut of <i>The Cider House Rules</i>, <i>My Movie Business</i> often verges on self-justification. Irving's respect for the movie's ultimate caretaker, Swedish director Lasse Hallstrom, is evident, as is his hopeful enthusiasm for the project's casting (which includes Michael Caine, Tobey McGuire, Jane Alexander, and Charlize Theron). Yet Irving can't repress the wariness prompted by his earlier disappointments with both this and other novels.</p><p> Ultimately, such candor doesn't diminish the account's value as a post mortem of the creative process behind serious filmmaking, nor does it overpower the reliable grace of Irving's prose. Fans will also find <i>My Movie Business</i> revealing in its exploration of the inspiration behind <i>The Cider House Rules</i> and its eloquent stance against the antiabortion movement--Irving's own grandfather, a leading doctor, administrator, and Harvard professor of obstetrics and gynecology. But moviegoers, as well as those who haven't read Irving's original novel, should be forewarned that this memoir does reveal key plot elements of both. <i>--Sam Sutherland</i></p>After two producers, four directors, thirteen years, and uncounted rewrites, the movie version of John Irving&#39;s acclaimed novel The Cider House Rules at last made it to the big screen, winning two Academy Awards (including one to John Irving for Best Adapted Screenplay). Here is the author&#39;s account of the novel-to-film process. Anecdotal, affectionate, and delightfully candid, My Movie Business dazzles with Irving&#39;s incomparable wit and style.</p><h2>Hammerfall</h2><p><p>One of the most renowned figures in science fiction, C. J. Cherryh has been enthralling audiences for nearly thirty years with rich and complex novels. Now at the peak of her career, this three-time Hugo Award Winner launches her most ambitious work in decades, <em>Hammerfall,</em> part of a far-ranging series, <em>The Gene Wars,</em> set in an entirely new universe scarred by the most vicious of future weaponry, nanotechnology. In this brilliant novel -- possibly Cherryh's masterwork -- the fate of billions has come down to a confrontation between two profoundly alien cultures on a single desert planet.</p><p></p><em>"The mad shall be searched out and given to the Ila's<br> messengers. No man shall conceal madness in his wife,<br> or his son, or his daughter, or his father.<br> Every one must be delivered up."</em><p></p><p></p>-- The Book of the Ila's Au'it<p></p><p>Marak has suffered the madness his entire life. He is a prince and warrior, strong and shrewd and expert in the ways of the desert covering his planet. In the service of his father, he has dedicated his life to overthrowing the Ila, the mysterious eternal dictator of his world. For years he has successfully hidden the visions that plague him -- voices pulling him eastward, calling <em>Marak, Marak, Marak,</em> amid mind-twisting visions of a silver tower. But when his secret is discovered, Marak is betrayed by his own father and forced to march in an endless caravan with the rest of his world's madmen to the Ila's city of Oburan.</p><p>Instead of death, Marak finds in Oburan his destiny, and the promise of life -- if he can survive what is surely a suicidal mission. The Ila wants him to discover the source of the voices and visions that afflict the mad. Despite the dangers of the hostile desert, tensions within the caravan, and his own excruciating doubts, Marak miraculously reaches his goal -- only to be given another, even more impossible mission by the strange people in the towers.</p><p>According to these beings who look like him yet act differently than anyone he has ever known, Marak has a slim chance to save his world's people from the wrath of the Ilas enemies. But to do so, he must convince them all -- warring tribes, villagers, priests, young and old, as well as the Ila herself -- to follow him on an epic trek across the burning desert before the hammer of the Ila's foes falls from the heavens above.</p><p>Written with deceptive simplicity and lyricism, this riveting, fast-paced epic of war, love, and survival in a brave new world marks a major achievement from the masterful C.J. Cherryh.</p></p><p><p>C. J. Cherryh&#x2014;three-time winner of the coveted Hugo Award&#x2014;is one of today's best-selling and most critically acclaimed writers of science fiction and fantasy. The author of more than fifty novels, she makes her home in Spokane, Washington.</p>In this well-done novel by the prolific, award-winning author of Precursor and Fortress of Dragons, two women with superhuman powers wage psychic and genetic war for control of a civilization. The common people remember the original colonization of their desert world in purely mythological terms as the First Descent. They're unaware that their seemingly immortal ruler, the Ila, has used nanotechnology to control their lives and modify their bodies for survival on their harsh planet. Marak Trin Tain, the outcast son of a desert bandit who unsuccessfully contested the Ila's rule, suffers from a terrifying form of madness. Like many others in this world, he sees visions and feels an almost overwhelming desire to walk out into the desert, heading blindly toward the east. When the Ila captures Marak, instead of executing him, she decides to send him (and a company of other madmen and women) on a desperate mission to discover the source of the obsession that draws them across their world. Unbeknownst to him, however, his civilization, indeed all life on his planet, is on the brink of destruction. Although this book may take place in a different universe from that of Cherryh's much praised Alliance-Union novels, it features her usual blend of gorgeous, slightly knotty prose, deeply conflicted heroes, desperate action and nicely observed cultural details. The first volume in her Gene Wars series, it leaves a number of loose threads to be tied up in later volumes, but is, in and of itself, an entirely satisfying novel. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Best of Roald Dahl: Stories from Over to You, Someone Like You, Kiss Kiss, and Switch Bitch</h2><p>The Best of Roald Dahl is a collection of 25 of Roald Dahl&#39;s short stories.</p><p></p><h2>Nature Cure: Philosophy &amp; Practice Based on the Unity of Disease &amp; Cure</h2><p>Dr. Henry Lindlahr&#39;s groundbreaking study on the science of natural health.

"Pappy" used some of these volumes to run an academic prep service; the rest he used in his unending pursuit of wisdom. His son's pursuits were quite different-"money, hoes, and clothes." The teenage Williams wore Medusa- faced Versace sunglasses and a hefty gold medallion, dumbed down and thugged up his speech, and did whatever else he could to fit into the intoxicating hip-hop culture that surrounded him. Like all his friends, he knew exactly where he was the day Biggie Smalls died, he could recite the lyrics to any Nas or Tupac song, and he kept his woman in line, with force if necessary. <br><br> But Pappy, who grew up in the segregated South and hid in closets so he could read Aesop and Plato, had a different destiny in mind for his son. For years, Williams managed to juggle two disparate lifestyles- "keeping it real" in his friends' eyes and studying for the SATs under his father's strict tutelage. As college approached and the stakes of the thug lifestyle escalated, the revolving door between Williams's street life and home life threatened to spin out of control. Ultimately, Williams would have to decide between hip-hop and his future. Would he choose "street dreams" or a radically different dream- the one Martin Luther King spoke of or the one Pappy held out to him now?<br><br> Williams is the first of his generation to measure the seductive power of hip-hop against its restrictive worldview, which ultimately leaves those who live it powerless. <i>Losing My Cool</i> portrays the allure and the danger of hip-hop culture like no book has before. Even more remarkably, Williams evokes the subtle salvation that literature offers and recounts with breathtaking clarity a burgeoning bond between father and son.<br><br> Watch a Video</p><p><strong>Thomas Chatterton Williams's Playlist Inspired by <em>Losing My Cool</em></strong> <br> Listen to Thomas Chatterton Williams's annotated playlist, a lineup of ten essential hip-hop tracks that informed <em>Losing My Cool</em>, including highlights from Dr. Dre, 2pac, and Jay-Z. <p></p><br> <p>Browse the playlist</p> <p><br></p> <strong>A Conversation with Thomas Chatterton Williams</strong> <br> <p><strong>Q: Tell us a little bit about yourself. </strong></p> <p>I grew up in New Jersey, but my parents are from out west. They moved the family to New Jersey when my father, a sociologist by training, took a job in Newark running anti-poverty programs for the Episcopal Archdiocese. My father &#x201c;Pappy&#x201d; who is black, is from Galveston and Fort Worth, Texas. My mother, who is white, is from San Diego. They both lament the decision to move east.</p> <p>I spent the first year of my life in Newark, but was raised in Fanwood, a solidly middle-class suburb with a white side and a black side. We lived on the white side of town mainly because Pappy, who had grown up under formal segregation, refused out of principle to ever again let anyone tell him where to live.</p> <p>I studied philosophy at Georgetown University in Washington D.C., and more recently, attended graduate school at New York University.</p> <p><strong>Q: Why did you write this book? </strong></p> <p>I started writing this book out of a searing sense of frustration. It was 2007, hip-hop had sunk to new depths with outrageously ignorant artists like the Dip Set and Soulja Boy dominating the culture and airwaves, and something inside me just snapped. I was in grad school at NYU and one of my teachers gave the class the assignment of writing an op-ed article on a topic of choice, the only requirement being to take a strong stand. I went straight from class to the library and in three or four hours banged out a heartfelt 1000 words against what I saw as the debasement of black culture in the hip-hop era. After some revisions, the Washington Post published what I had written and it generated a lot of passionate feedback, both for and against. I realized that there was a serious conversation to be had on this subject and that there was a lot more that I wanted to say besides. That was why I started.</p> <p>By the time I finished writing, though, it had become something quite different, something very personal, a tribute to my father and to previous generations of black men and women who went through unimaginable circumstances and despite that, or rather because of it, would be ashamed of the things we as a culture now preoccupy ourselves with, rap about, and do on a daily basis.</p> <p>Basically, the book began as a Dear John letter to my peers and ended as a love letter to my father.</p> <p><strong>Q: You fully embraced the black culture of BET and rap superstars starting at a young age. What drew you in? </strong></p> <p>I think I was drawn to black culture by the same things that have been drawing the entire world to it since the days of Richard Wright, Josephine Baker and Louis Armstrong. This culture is original, potent and seductive. As we all know, the evil of slavery and the sting of the whip have given us many things including the voice of Nina Simone, the prose of James Baldwin, the Air Jordan sneaker, the blues, jazz, moonwalking, and more recently gangsta rap.</p> <p>What matters here is not that I found the black hip-hop driven culture that I was surrounded by alluring&#x2014;that&#x2019;s not significant, unique or particularly interesting. The crucial point is that this culture exerted a seriously negative influence on my black peers and me, and it did so in a way and to a degree that it didn&#x2019;t for non-blacks. The main reason for this, I firmly believe, is that we (blacks) tended to approach hip-hop seriously and earnestly, striving to &#x201c;keep it real&#x201d; and viewing a lifestyle governed by hip-hop values as some kind of prerequisite to an authentically black existence. Non-blacks were better able to embrace hip-hop with a healthy sense of irony.</p> <p><strong>Q: Your father tutored you throughout your life, yet you still seem awed that you escaped the allure of hip-hop culture. Where are your high school classmates today? </strong></p> <p>Yes, I was and still am awed! Let&#x2019;s be honest, like many committed parents my father faced daunting odds getting me away from the foolishness that surrounded us. Because we were not wealthy and living in seclusion, it was basically him and my mother against a neighborhood and high school of bad role models who were working in conjunction with a relentless and powerful propaganda campaign that streamed into the house 24/7 via Hot 97 FM, Black Entertainment Television and MTV. The odds were that his message would be drowned out in a cacophony of bullshit.</p> <p>To answer the second question&#x2014;and to be precise, we&#x2019;re just talking about blacks and Latinos when we talk about my classmates here because I wasn&#x2019;t really around anyone else in those days&#x2014;I haven&#x2019;t kept up with any of the classmates I mention in the book with the exception of Charles, who is like a brother to my brother and me and a son to my parents. Charles is doing fantastic, having recently graduated from one of the top two law schools in the country.</p> <p>From what I hear and occasionally see on Facebook, no one else has done anything close to that. That&#x2019;s sad to me because there were many other students who were intelligent enough to go that far, but they didn&#x2019;t. Without my father&#x2019;s encouragement and guidance, of course, I don&#x2019;t think that Charles and I would have gone far either. The culture was stifling. None of us (except for one or two good girls who come to mind, but who were not influential at all on the rest of us) considered being smart very &#x201c;real.&#x201d; Most of the others that I mention in the book seem to be in solidly mediocre positions, having grown into adults with varying degrees of success. Some have done okay, but some have utterly failed. Some are happily married and some still dream of becoming rappers, which floors me. The girls seem to have done better than the boys. Are they all a bunch of criminals and crackheads? No, not at all, and I want to emphasize that. But was there a lot of needlessly squandered potential? Yes, absolutely.</p> <p><strong>Q: Your father owned 15,000 books, but says that he has never read for enjoyment. What is the difference between your attitude toward books and your father&#x2019;s? </strong></p> <p>It&#x2019;s true, Pappy is in his 70s and to this day he still underlines articles in the newspaper every morning. My father loves to read, but he can&#x2019;t simply relax with a good book. Reading will always be work for him. He always felt pressure to read for the purpose of obtaining practical knowledge (even from novels). He was born black in the segregated south in the 1930s, and he figured out early on that if he didn&#x2019;t teach himself what he needed to know through books no one else would. I contrast this with my own view that it&#x2019;s nice to enjoy literature for purely aesthetic reasons.</p> <p>In college and in my early 20s, I read for the latter reason mainly, for beauty and quixotic epiphany, both of which are valuable things, but a bit luxurious, too. Today, as a writer and someone who cares deeply about sentences, I find myself reading for many more practical reasons than I used to. I read for technical and inspirational knowledge about my craft. In that way I am more like my father than I used to be. However, I&#x2019;m also always on the lookout for beauty for beauty&#x2019;s sake and nothing more. I see it both ways now.</p> <p><strong>Q: In the book you describe Georgetown as &#x201c;an outpost of white and international privilege&#x201d; nestled into one of our country&#x2019;s blackest cities. What was your attitude going into your first year? And upon graduating? </strong></p> <p>Georgetown is certainly that. Going into my first year, my attitude was essentially that I would be an alien there; at most I would just be passing through. I had no animosity toward the wider non-black world, I just couldn&#x2019;t imagine myself reflected in it. It wasn&#x2019;t real to me. By the time I graduated, I had become a stranger to the hip-hop culture I had grown up in. Crucially, though, I didn&#x2019;t feel that I had started selling out or acting white at all. Actually, I felt prouder than ever to be black&#x2014;it&#x2019;s just my definition of what black could be had begun to expand dramatically.</p> <p><strong>Q: At different points in <em>Losing My Cool</em>, you identify hip-hop as &#x201c;a culture,&#x201d; &#x201c;a way of being in the world,&#x201d; as like a religion, an &#x201c;opiate,&#x201d; &#x201c;captor,&#x201d; &#x201c;nation,&#x201d; and, well, just music. What does hip-hop signify to you today? </strong></p> <p>For a lot of people I know, hip-hop is still all of those things, so it signifies all of that to me still. In my own life, though, more than anything, hip-hop is now the sound of my childhood and adolescence. It signifies the past and not the future. Of course, anything that reminds you of your growing up years is going to be special to you in certain ways, but I see hip-hop, by its very nature, as basically an obstacle to serious engagement with the world.</p> <p><strong>Q: Do Kanye, Jay-Z, and other current rap superstars have anything to offer society? </strong></p> <p>The thing I want to stress here is that it has never been my aim or desire to criticize hip-hop from a musical or formal standpoint. For one thing, I&#x2019;m not qualified to do that, and for another, I&#x2019;m already convinced that it is formally very interesting and worthy of respect from a variety of perspectives.</p> <p>So with that said, yes, I do think artists like Jay-Z and Kanye West especially have something to offer society, and that is the spectacle of their talent. These are extraordinarily talented cats. Jay-Z&#x2019;s wordplay on songs like &#x201c;D&#x2019;Evils&#x201d; or &#x201c;Can I Live?&#x201d; surpasses what most Harvard and Yale graduates can do with language. As for Kanye West, he&#x2019;s got to be one of the most gifted and original popular musicians of his generation in any genre. The things he hears you and I don&#x2019;t hear.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s no secret that we all love to discover and marvel at talent, put it on a pedestal and gawk at it. But in my opinion, what these guys do for us seldom or never gets any deeper than merely displaying that they are clever, and doing so in strictly solipsistic ways. In terms of their ethics, interests, values, and the lyrical content of their work, these rappers have very little that is enriching and lots that is actually very damaging to offer their listeners. They engage us in a catchy way so we admire them for it, and hunger after what they produce, but it&#x2019;s empty calories at best. The truth is that there&#x2019;s very little that is nutritious to consume there. You can gain far more from an hour spent with Joan Didion or James Baldwin than with Jay-Z, period.</p> <p><strong>Q: How does your father feel about <em>Losing My Cool</em>? </strong></p> <p>My father named me after a writer, always encouraged me to be a writer, and worked extremely hard to equip me with the tools to become one, so this book is my way of saying thanks to him and I think he gets that. The first time he read the book I was nervous, though, because he&#x2019;s an intensely private man and here I was writing a memoir and exposing things about myself that he might find vulgar or embarrassing. Unlike with my mother and brother, I never let him read the manuscript; I waited until I had galleys before I shared it with him. When I finally gave him a copy, he took it upstairs to his reading room and read the whole thing straight through. And he took notes on it! He identified two minor factual errors in the text, which was really helpful. Other than that, he didn&#x2019;t say much immediately about it, we just sat down and watched some NFL, but I knew that he was very happy because he was in a really playful mood throughout the game, laughing and joking with my mother and me.</p> <p>Since then he&#x2019;s read the book cover to cover at least three more times, underlining it extensively (always underlining!). We&#x2019;ve spoken a lot about the more philosophical subject matter, which comes up later in the book, like Heidegger&#x2019;s idea that groups rob the individual of him or herself. This is an important point for my father. Pappy is almost never in crowds, and he doesn&#x2019;t belong to any scene and never has. That&#x2019;s because, he says, he&#x2019;s been trying his whole life to define himself and not be defined by others. I think he&#x2019;s proud that I was able to touch on this.</p> <p><strong>Q: Is there anything you&#x2019;d like to go back and tell your low slung jeans-wearing, basketballing, game-running former self? </strong></p> <p>Most definitely! I&#x2019;d say: Life is long and the world is wide, so it&#x2019;s important as hell to guard against making choices that pointlessly limit you down the road. And also, it&#x2019;s better to be open and flexible than closed and hard. And also, when you&#x2019;re tall and slim, it&#x2019;s much, much more flattering to the physique to wear clothes that fit. And also&#x2014;pay more attention in French class, please!</p> <p><strong>Q: What can we do to overcome the negative aspects of hip-hop culture such as self-hatred, emphasis on failure, willful ignorance? </strong></p> <p>The first thing we have to do is get serious. The world is a serious place&#x2014;the climate is changing and we are at war&#x2014;and way too many of us are walking around worrying about utter trivialities, such as what 50 Cent said about Rick Ross or what shoes Kanye West wore.</p> <p>In the book, I describe a time in my early high school years when I was playing basketball with members of the St. Anthony Friars, one of the best, if not the best, boy&#x2019;s varsity teams in the nation. These kids there were dedicated to the game of basketball the way many black kids I know are dedicated to hip-hop, to such an extent it is almost unbelievable if you take a step back and think about it. In fact for young black men hip-hop and playing sports, particularly basketball, go hand-in-hand. What&#x2019;s heartbreaking to me is that if these kids had ever put similar effort into developing their minds, some of them would now be inventing ways to combat global warming, some would be curing cancer, and one or two would be writing the next great American novel. Almost none of the members of the Friars team, if any, now play in the NBA, so what was it all for?</p> <p>The second thing is that we really have to expand our idea of what it means to be black. Being authentically black has to mean something much more than merely being cool, athletic, sexy, thugged-out, from the &#x2018;hood, or &#x201c;real.&#x201d; To that end, I think the election of Barack Obama was earth-shattering and we will start reaping the tangible rewards five, ten, fifteen, twenty years down the road. At least, that is what I sincerely wish for.</p> <p><strong>Q: What do you hope readers will take away from <em>Losing My Cool</em>? </strong></p> <p>I hope that<em> Losing My Cool </em>will provoke readers black, white, old and young to question, critique, and ultimately reject more of the nonsense and conformity that surrounds us all.</p> <p>(Photo of Thomas Chatterton Williams ï¿½ Luke Abiol)</p><strong>Advance Reader Reviews from BookBrowse</strong><br> Rated of 5 by Froma F. (Boulder, CO) <br>Powerful indictment of hip hop culture <br>This is an important book. Williams chronicles his life in hip hop culture and his eventual break from that culture as he moves away from negative values (empty materialism, denigration of women) into a life of self examination. Along the way he becomes a philosophy major and Williams is particularly gifted at explaining difficult concepts in language that makes them seem quite simple. Although this is not an introduction to Heidegger or Hegel, you will walk away understanding the ideas they propound. The book is filled with extraordinary insight about the values hip hop culture promotes, what it is like to grow up middle class and black in America and how pernicious the hip hop values are for most young, black people. Williams is very insightful and is most compelling when he reflects on his life. One caveat: Williams seems somewhat uncomfortable and overly self-conscious when writing about himself and the people he knows and in the early part of the book, the writing is stilted. Persist! This is a book that is well worth reading. <br><br>Rated of 5 by Maria P. (Washington, DC) <br>Culture Shift <br>The ideas proposed in this book offer a culture shift away from what some believe to be popular, cool and hip. Hip today is not what hip was yesterday, and will not be what hip is tomorrow. The challenge for the young who want to be part of a group for reasons of safety, coolness or just belonging is to find the thoughts that can help create a cool, safe free society. The challenge for adults is to remember that what they do and say is heard and repeated by future generations. In "Losing My Cool" the family is challenging and wise and strongest group of all. <br><br>Rated of 5 by Marta M. (Tustin, CA) <br>An interesting read <br>I found this book very interesting. In fact I couldn't put it down and I was reading it while on vacation. On vacation I usually read fiction. The author is well educated and the book is well written. It explained a lot to me about my fifth grade students. They all fans of hip-hop music but not so much with the education. This gives me a small insight into their world. This might help me in teaching them. I liked the way he blended philosophy with the fascinating story of his life. I don't think we have heard the last of this smart young man. I think that this is an important book that should be read by all. <br><br>Rated of 5 by Terye B. (Scotts Valley, CA) <br>How cool is cool? <br>This was a fascinating story on so many levels. A young black man struggles for his identity and finds it in the black culture of Hip Hop and BET television. While fitting into a crowd, a group he never gets to know his true self. When away at college he finds himself and learns to appreciate the structured, collegiate life his father was preparing him for since childhood. This true story is told in an easy tone, and brings back all the teenage struggles for acceptance and the awakening of adulthood. I would highly recommend this for a book group. <br><br>Rated of 5 by Irene M. (Ashland, OR) <br>Losing My Cool <br>This book is fascinating. I have not read anything that so clearly defines the peer pressure for young blacks in today's culture. I enjoyed reading about this author's decision-making process, and the influences that took him from a hip- hop life on the streets of his home town to become a graduate of Georgetown University with major in philosophy. <br><br>Rated of 5 by Kendra R. (New Orleans, LA) <br>Engaging and thought provoking <br>I found it so engaging I read it in a day. Williams provides insight into what draws people into the hip-hop lifestyle as well as what it means to be black today. As he evolves his perspective, so follows the narrative. I'm already looking forward to rereading it and sharing it with friends so we can discuss it, black and white together. <br><br>Rated of 5 by Barbara C. (Riverside, CA) <br>A Father's Love <br>Being the age of Thomas' father myself, that relationship was the thread that I followed through the book. The book was rich with philosophical turns, anecdotes, history, and culture from a very non-typical perspective....but very much driven by the loving, strong father. The book had so many facets to understand--hip hop to Hegel in 200 pages. I guess my desire would be to sit down at the table with Pappy and Thomas and understand the subtle nuances between their middle class and mine. I loved the book and couldn't put it down! <br><br>Rated of 5 by Beverly D. (Palm Harbor, FL) <br>a young man's look at hip hop <br>Williams examines the seductiveness and potential dangers of the hip hop lifestyle as it applied to him as a young man growing up in Plainfield,N.J. Ultimately finding his "place" through the study of Hegel, Heidegger and his father's unending belief in study &amp; learning, Williams is able to love the music but ignore the philosophy and find his way as a young African -American philosopher and first time author. <br><br>Rated of 5 by Constance S. (Sacramento, CA) <br>Losing My Cool <br>It was difficult to read this well written, seemingly honest memoir by Thomas Chatterton Williams when I realized I was at odds with his conclusion about the reason so many African American students do poorly in school. He writes that they feel the need to adhere to only one culture, the hip hop one, and distance themselves from all others. This is called "keeping it real". As a Black woman I see this as only one of the causes. The hip hop culture through music,movies, TV and materialism is fed non-stop to our children and it is seductive. Nothing else seems to grant many youngsters the feeling of solidarity and the swagger and the elusive cool. To turn away from this is considered being disloyal and acting white. It is better to remain with the group than to seek many other avenues of success through education. <em>Losing My Cool</em> deserves four stars for creating a three dimensional picture of the hip hop world; and four stars for the very inspiring description of his awakening through his father's intellectual assistance and determination. I enjoyed his many references to philosophers and authors. I bookmarked and underlined his many well chosen quotations. <br><br>Rated of 5 by Susan R. (Dublin, NH) <br>Anticipating the next chapters in this man's life <br>This thoughtful memoir is written by a young man whose mother is white and whose father is a black man who came up in the pre-integration south. When he finally got the opportunity, Mr. Williams senior embraced books and scholarship wholeheartedly. Growing up in a relatively white NJ suburb, the author and his brother bought completely into black culture as portrayed by BET and rap music. This is the story of how he moved selectively to the norms of the larger society. It's an interesting book with a few magnificent passages. <br><br>Rated of 5 by Rosario D. (South El Monte, CA) <br>Losing My Cool to Hip-Hop <br>An interesting view at how hip-hop formed the mentality of Thomas and his friends so that their lives go hand-in-hand with the hip-hop lyrics they hear. Through the perseverance, advice, and love of his father, Thomas realizes that he can do more with his life than just listen to hip-hop and "keep it real". I really enjoyed this book, it is always nice to read a story about someone that was able to realize his/her full potential. Thomas shows us that is possible to follow ones dreams instead of doing what everyone else is doing. I also enjoyed the philosophical view of this book and believe that Thomas did a wonderful job of explain it towards the end of the book. Whether you agree or disagree with him, this is a must read in today's world where many of us are afraid to be individuals and instead decide to be part of the crowd. <br><br>Rated of 5 by Vicky S. (Torrance, CA) <br>Questioning values <br>I enjoyed the questioning of values that the author experiences as he encounters a variety of other blacks or African-Americans, and non-blacks that he initially dismisses when he goes from high school to Georgetown University. The text would make for interesting book club discussions as the individuals could draw parallels to similar soul searching they have made when faced with challenges to their own values. <br><br>Rated of 5 by Nancy O. (Hobe Sound, FL) <br>When you need a bit of inspiration... <br><em>Losing My Cool</em> is one person's story about how he learned to "interpret and navigate the world around us." There's always more out there, if you want it, and more importantly, it's attainable, as Williams shows in his touching story. This is a valuable message for everyone. It's an engrossing story -- I couldn't put it down once I'd picked it up. Williams is a talented writer -- I hope we see more from him in the future. Losing My Cool is definitely a book I would recommend to others. <br><br>Rated of 5 by WDH (New Port Richey, FL) <br>Thoughtful Voice <br>I like the author's voice throughout the book. He chronicles growing up and trying to find your place in the world very well. He is thoughtful in how he examines his life and the lives of his friends and his views about getting caught up in a culture and believing you are something you really are not are thought-provoking. The author acknowledges his father (and to a lesser degree his mother) and provides a showcase for the power and influence a key person with love, strength, patience and perseverance can have over a child's life. The description of his father's library and his love of books and knowledge was in itself a powerful message. This book is a good read.</p><h2>Fashion in the &#39;70s: The Definitive Sourcebook</h2><p>Featuring 600 totally original period photographs and illustrations - completely redefining the appraisal of 1970s fashion</p><p>Emmanuelle Dirix is a highly regarded fashion historian and curator.

A survivor, he is guided in all things by his unfailing loyalty and honesty. But a tragic altercation in Minnesota's North Woods that leaves a young man dead and suspicions of murder hanging in the air tests Harry's courage as never before. Nothing could have prepared him for the eerie silence that has fallen over the incident, the challenge to his nerve, and the raw carnality of his best friend's wife.</p><p>Digging for answers in a town ready to lash out in fear of the dark secrets he is moving ever closer to, Harry ignores the signs of danger at his own peril. Until it all ignites in a fire of unexpected betrayal and a bloody settling of accounts.</p></p><p>A winter hunting trip that explodes in tragic death...a snake-pit of small-town secrets...and a chilling mystery that reaches from the past, setting men and women against one another in a whiteout of violence, blackmail and vigilante justice. <p>These are the elements that announce Chuck Logan's remarkable debut thriller as one of the year's most exciting discoveries. </p><p>Harry Griffin is a quiet loner whose current profession as an illustrator for a big-city newspaper gives no hint of his hard-knocks background. Witness to some of war's rawest moments and survivor of a battle with alcoholism, Harry's only constant is loyalty. He is a man who pays his debts. </p><p>Hence, when old friend Bud Maston, one of the state's richest men, insists Harry join him on a hunting trip, he goes. But nothing has prepared Harry for the raw carnality of Jesse Deucette -- the new Mrs. Maston. And once Harry is stranded with her at Bud's snowbound lodge, events rapidly spiral toward tragedy. </p><p>On the opening morning of deer season, Harry thwarts an attempt on Bud's life. Haunted by the blood he has spilled, Harry seeks answers. And the answers lie in Stanley, Minnesota -- where Jesse Deucette-Maston uses her deadly allure to manipulate and cajole, and everyone seems to have a dark secret. Ultimately, Harry turns over enough stones to bring the town's roiling cauldron of hypocrisy and deviancy to a boil. In the novel's climax, he learns both the best and the worst that humans are capable of.</p><p>Chuck Logan is the author of eight novels, including <em>After the Rain</em>, <em>Vapor Trail</em>, <em>Absolute Zero</em>, and <em>The Big Law</em>.

He sees that America is in the midst of a fierce culture war between those who embrace traditional values and those who want to change America into a &#x201c;secular-progressive&#x201d; country. This is a conflict that differs in many ways from the usual liberal/conservative divide, but it is no less heated, and the stakes are even higher.<br><br>In <i>Culture Warrior</i>, Bill O&#x2019;Reilly defines this war and analyzes the competing philosophies of the traditionalist and secular-progressive camps. He examines why the nation&#x2019;s motto &#x201c;E Pluribus Unum&#x201d; (&#x201c;From Many, One&#x201d;) might change to &#x201c;What About Me?&#x201d;; dissects the forces driving the secular-progressive agenda in the media and behind the scenes, including George Soros, George Lakoff, and the ACLU; and dives into matters of race, education, and the war on terror. He also shows how the culture war has played out in such high-profile instances as <i>The Passion of the Christ</i>, <i>Fahrenheit 9/11</i>, the abuse epidemic (child and otherwise), and the embattled place of religion in public life&#x2014;with special emphasis on the war against Christmas. Whatever controversies are roiling the nation, he fearlessly confronts them&#x2014;and no one will be in the dark about which side he&#x2019;s on.<br><br><i>Culture Warrior</i> showcases Bill O&#x2019;Reilly at his most eloquent and impassioned. He is an unrelenting fighter for the soul of America, and in this book he fights the good fight for the traditional values that have served this country so well for so long.</p><p><p><b>BILL O&#x2019;REILLY</b>, a two-time Emmy Award winner for excellence in reporting, served as national correspondent for ABC News and as anchor of the nationally syndicated news magazine program<i> Inside Edition</i> before becoming executive producer and anchor of Fox News&#x2019;s wildly popular <i>The O&#x2019;Reilly Factor</i>.

No way around it. At some point, every one of us is confronted with danger or injustice. How we choose to combat that challenge is often life-defining. You can face difficulties head-on, or run from them, or ignore them until they consume you. But no one escapes conflict. No one.<br><br>In my experience of more than thirty years of practicing journalism, I&#x2019;ve found that most people do not like to fight. No surprise there. Battle is not only exhausting and dangerous; it also requires skill and discipline to emerge victorious, much less unscathed.<br><br>That&#x2019;s why few of us, except for some weirdly self-destructive souls, seek out conflict. In fact, putting yourself at risk goes against our natural impulse of self-preservation. Whenever I&#x2019;ve witnessed strife, I&#x2019;ve met far more villains than heroes, but both are relatively rare. Most human beings are neither heroes nor villains but decent people who choose to sit things out until pushed beyond a reasonable limit.<br><br>For a variety of reasons that I will explain, I have chosen to jump into the fray and become a warrior in the vicious culture war that is currently under way in the United States of America. And war is exactly the right term. On one side of the battlefield are the armies of the traditionalists like me, people who believe the United States was well founded and has done enormous good for the world. On the other side are the committed forces of the secular-progressive movement that want to change America dramatically: mold it in the image of Western Europe. Notice I did not say anything about &#x201c;conservatives against liberals.&#x201d; This is not the real culture fight, as I&#x2019;ll make clear. The talk-radio mantra of the left versus the right doesn&#x2019;t even come close to defining<br>the culture war in America&#x2013;it is much more complicated than that.<br><br>Rather surprisingly, at least to me, one result of my decision to fight in this war has been financial success. Another result has been a measure of fame. Chances are you know who I am and what I do. But you may not understand <i>why</i> I do what I do. That, as they say on TV, is coming up.<br><br>The culture war has also made me perhaps the most controversial broadcaster in the country. That hot-button label &#x201c;controversial&#x201d; gives my enemies, they think, the right to attack me and my enterprises ceaselessly, unfairly, even dementedly. I truly drive the opposing force nuts! As you may know, I&#x2019;m engaged in fighting them on a daily basis,<br>and that warfare is the subject of this book.<br><br>Maybe it helps that many of my Irish ancestors were warriors. They lived in County Cavan and fought Oliver Cromwell when he devastated Ireland in the name of the British Commonwealth. They lost that fight. Later, some of them emigrated to America during the great famine of the 1840s. More came later. My paternal grandfather fought in World War I, then became a New York City police officer. He was one tough SOB. I have his billy club in my desk drawer. It was well used. Come to think of it, maybe I was named after that club.<br><br>In the next generation&#x2019;s world war, my father was a naval officer and was on the scene during the occupation of Japan. He was by nature a warrior but, in an interesting contradiction, was also frightened by the unknown, the Great Depression having imposed upon my father a fear that he never defeated. Even so, his instincts were to combat injustice and scorn those who ran from necessary conflict. But his reluctance to challenge authority and take chances in his career and life would stifle his potential. I watched throughout my growing years as he was slowly beaten down by the system. The problem was that Dad was very bright and creative, but his job converting foreign currency into dollars was pure drudgery. My father died young, at age sixty-two. Observing him, I vowed never to allow the &#x201c;system&#x201d; to beat me or to let any individual push me around as his direct superiors did him.<br><br>So far, I&#x2019;m ahead on that score.<br><br>I can tell you truthfully that I never envisioned myself crusading against establishment forces like the <i>New York Times</i> and today&#x2019;s vast armies of far-left and far-right zealots. Coming out of Boston University with a master&#x2019;s degree in broadcast journalism in 1975, I wanted to be one of the Woodward and Bernstein guys. You know, do serious investigative work and right wrongs by exposing corruption. I also wanted to cover war and study human conflict firsthand. In my journalistic career, I succeeded in reaching those goals and count myself very fortunate to have done so.<br><br>Then life, as it usually does, presented me with a completely unanticipated opportunity. After having national success on a syndicated program called <i>Inside Edition</i>, I went back to school. And not just any school: At the age of forty-six, I earned a master&#x2019;s degree in public administration from Harvard&#x2019;s Kennedy School of Government. It was while studying in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that I worked up the game plan for <i>The O&#x2019;Reilly Factor</i>. The rest, to use a clichï¿½, is history.<br><br><i>The Factor</i> concept is very simple: Watch all of those in power, including and especially the media, so they don&#x2019;t injure or exploit the folks, everyday Americans. Never before in the United States had a television news guy dared to criticize other journalists on a regular basis. The late Peter Jennings, a friend, told me I was crazy to do it. &#x201c;These people will not allow anyone to scrutinize them,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They will come after you with a vengeance.&#x201d;<br><br>And so they have.<br><br>In fact, not since the late Howard Cosell has an American broadcaster been so roundly vilified in print as I have been over the past decade. &#x201c;Gasbag,&#x201d; &#x201c;blowhard,&#x201d; &#x201c;demagogue&#x201d;&#x2013;these are common adjectives used when newspaper writers refer to me. I&#x2019;m not whining, just stating a fact. Because I criticize what I consider to be dishonest and unfair media, and extremist pundits on <i>both</i> the right and the left as well as corrupt and/or ineffective politicians, there is no shortage of people trying to marginalize me, or worse, destroy me.<br><br>Because of the very personal nature of the battle I have chosen to fight, this is a difficult book to write. I don&#x2019;t like to sound bitter, but the truth is, I <i>am</i> bitter to some extent. Although I have won far more battles than I&#x2019;ve lost, my life has changed drastically. I am routinely threatened with physical harm and have to employ security. I have to absorb rank defamation in the press, with no legal recourse because I&#x2019;m a &#x201c;public figure.&#x201d; My family has also been threatened and I&#x2019;ve had to change every aspect of my life. No longer can I behave as a &#x201c;regular guy&#x201d; and go out and cut loose with my friends. No longer can I even engage a stranger in conversation&#x2013;there are too many crazies out there. At work, every call I receive is monitored and every interaction I have has to be witnessed. I am never off the job and am always on guard. Would you want to live that way?<br><br>Still, to quote Hyman Roth in <i>The Godfather II</i>, &#x201c;This is the business we&#x2019;ve chosen.&#x201d; And it&#x2019;s true. I don&#x2019;t have to be a culture warrior. I could make millions doing straight anchor work or just writing books. But I&#x2019;m on a mission, one that I&#x2019;m going to define for you throughout this book, and the mission is important.<br><br>At this point, all the conflict has been worth it. <i>The Factor</i> has changed many things in America and put a horde of bad guys on the defensive and some out of business. Of course, some Americans see me as the bad guy. They are entitled to their opinion. But after ten years of unprecedented success, millions of you understand that my programs are trying to fight the good fight. You know the culture war is serious and needs to be fought honestly and effectively. We do that on <i>The Factor</i>. And we do it with no fear.<br><br>In this book I will try to put the war into perspective. I will try to avoid cheap shots and vindictiveness. This is definitely not a &#x201c;hit&#x201d; book written in an attempt to destroy certain people. I&#x2019;ll leave that kind of nastiness to smear merchants like Al Franken and Michael Weiner (aka Michael Savage)&#x2013;people who try to ruin people in order to make money. It would be foolish and a waste of your time to engage the lunatic fringe in these pages, although the temptation is strong. Occasionally, I&#x2019;ll make an example of a smear merchant to demonstrate a point, but I&#x2019;ll keep that sort of thing to a minimum.<br><br>My reasoning is simple: Why dignify slander and libel by repeating them in print? Yes, I do truly despise the ideological fanatics, the media vermin who couldn&#x2019;t care less about truth or justice. But you know who they are. I have bigger, more dangerous targets in my sights&#x2013;establishment players who can change your life with the stroke of a pen, an activist court ruling, or a dishonest article in the press. My goal is to expose and defeat people who have the power to do you great harm. My weapons will be facts and superior analysis based on those facts. It is absolutely fair and vital to democracy to confront people in the arena of ideas. I&#x2019;ll leave the smears to the yapping character assassins. They will destroy themselves. Just wait and see.<br><br>Finally, I want to get back to Howard Cosell for a moment. I consider him one of America&#x2019;s greatest sports commentators, as well as a man who was absolutely fearless in the broadcast booth. If you missed Cosell on the air, consider this: At one point, according to a poll taken by <i>TV Guide</i>, he was cited as the most disliked sportscaster in America. . . and also the most <i>well</i> liked. In the same poll!

Clarke&#x2019;s writing for decades. With Time&#x2019;s Eye and Sunstorm, the first two books in their acclaimed Time Odyssey series, Clarke and his brilliant co-author Stephen Baxter imagined a near-future in which the Firstborn seek to stop the advance of human civilization by employing a technology indistinguishable from magic.<br><br>Their first act was the Discontinuity, in which Earth was carved into sections from different eras of history, restitched into a patchwork world, and renamed Mir. Mir&#x2019;s inhabitants included such notables as Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan, and United Nations peacekeeper Bisesa Dutt. For reasons unknown to her, Bisesa entered into communication with an alien artifact of inscrutable purpose and godlike power&#x2013;a power that eventually returned her to Earth. There, she played an instrumental role in humanity&#x2019;s race against time to stop a doomsday event: a massive solar storm triggered by the alien Firstborn designed to eradicate all life from the planet. That fate was averted at an inconceivable price. Now, twenty-seven years later, the Firstborn are back.<br><br>This time, they are pulling no punches: They have sent a &#x201c;quantum bomb.&#x201d; Speeding toward Earth, it is a device that human scientists can barely comprehend, that cannot be stopped or destroyed&#x2013;and one that will obliterate Earth.<br><br>Bisesa&#x2019;s desperate quest for answers sends her first to Mars and then to Mir, which is itself threatened with extinction. The end seems inevitable. But as shocking new insights emerge into the nature of the Firstborn and their chilling plans for mankind, an unexpected ally appears from light-years away.</p><p>Arthur C.

Their encounter begins when Michael Hawke, in whiteface, prances as a frog in front of the conjurer Max, who has just jolted the art world by inducing a Rembrandt painting to shed tears. With a sepulchral incantation, "Be a frog," the magician's next trick knocks Mike out and into the Plaza fountain. Thereafter Mike is mesmerized by the wizard's esoteric knowledge. Even those who scoff at mystical themes recognize the universality of the human weakness to know what others don't, and the late author rigs his novel with intricate, enthralling twists, from the reunion of the two principals, through the pupil's apprenticeship in a dilapidated theater, right on to the finale of a magic show, performed by the master of illusion and his newly trained assistant. At the performance's climax, the wizard transfers to Mike the symbol of his power, an amulet representing the Eye of Horus, but it nearly (and symbolically, as the cost of ambition) kills him and girlfriend Emily. Tryon's Faustian tale of the young hero's initiation and indoctrination is certain to be popular with occult fans; those hooked on yarns of magic a la Robertson Davies' Deptford Trilogy will join the crowd. And movie rights have been optioned to Paramount for a motion picture starring Tom Cruise. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>Whose Detroit?: Politics, Labor, and Race in a Modern American City</h2><p><p>America's urbanites have engaged in many tumultuous struggles for civil and worker rights since the Second World War. Heather Ann Thompson focuses in detail on the struggles of Motor City residents during the 1960s and early 1970s and finds that conflict continued to plague the inner city and its workplaces even after Great Society liberals committed themselves to improving conditions. </p><p>Using the contested urban center of Detroit as a model, Thompson assesses the role of such upheaval in shaping the future of America's cities. She argues that the glaring persistence of injustice and inequality led directly to explosions of unrest in this period. Thompson finds that unrest as dramatic as that witnessed during Detroit's infamous riot of 1967 by no means doomed the inner city, nor in any way sealed its fate. The politics of liberalism continued to serve as a catalyst for both polarization and radical new possibilities and Detroit remained a contested, and thus politically vibrant, urban center.</p><p>Thompson's account of the post-World War II fate of Detroit casts new light on contemporary urban issues, including white flight, police brutality, civic and shop floor rebellion, labor decline, and the dramatic reshaping of the American political order. Throughout, the author tells the stories of real events and individuals, including James Johnson, Jr., who, after years of suffering racial discrimination in Detroit's auto industry, went on trial in 1971 for the shooting deaths of two foremen and another worker at a Chrysler plant. </p><p><i>Whose Detroit? </i>brings the labor movement into the context of the literature of Sixties radicalism and integrates the history of the 1960s into the broader political history of the postwar period. Urban, labor, political, and African-American history are blended into Thompson's comprehensive portrayal of Detroit's reaction to pressures felt throughout the nation. With deft attention to the historical background and preoccupations of Detroit's residents, Thompson has written a biography of an entire city at a time of crisis.</p></p><p>"A valuable addition to literature on race, labor, and urban life in postwar America. Whose Detroit ? identifies the crucial link between shop floor and labor union issues, on the one hand, and broader urban political developments on the other."--Robert H. Zieger, University of Florida <p>"Heather Thompson uncovers as few others have the rich variety of black community and workplace organizations in Detroit in the 1960s and 1970s. Her effort to show the different responses of city leaders and union leaders to racial issues challenges the tendency either to merge these two groups or to overlook the distinctions between them."--Nancy Gabin, Purdue University </p><p>"Heather Thompson powerfully rewrites the narrative of the collapse of late-sixties liberalism and of the liberal/labor alliance. The 1967 riots were a turning point in the history of the Detroit Left, perhaps the most important radical community in the country during this period. Rather than accept the riots as a product of rising black militancy, impatience, and scapegoating of 'whitey,' Thompson argues that they played a key role in the ascendance of the Black Power movement."--Robin D.

Yet, while we hear these pleas, we're already functioning with existing beliefs&#x2015;even if they are beliefs by default. So how do we choose what to believe&#x2015;especially in the area of faith? Do we need to choose? In <i>Choosing Your Faith,</i> Mark Mittelberg encourages us, as Socrates does, not to lead an unexamined life. He invites us to examine why we believe what we believe. This examination will resonate with Christians and seekers alike.</p><p><p>Think about your day so far. This morning, you got up and, by faith, had breakfast, trusting that nobody in the house had laced your food with poison. You stopped at a coffee shop and somehow trusted those characters behind the counter (is that really a good idea?) not to put some kind of harmful or spoiled substance in your triple-shot, extra foam, grande latte. You got to work--maybe even took the elevator?--and sat in a chair, by faith, without testing it first to see if it was still strong enough to hold you up. You started your computer and typed in confidential information, even though you knew that the latest Internet virus could take that information and broadcast it to everyone in your address book. At lunch, you went out for a walk and paused to bend down and pat a stranger's dog, believing you wouldn't become one of the 4.7 million Americans bitten by a dog each year (of whom 1,008 have to go to the emergency room "every day"). Then, at the end of the workday, you aimed your car toward home and drove down the street, trusting-but-not-really-knowing that some sixteen-year-old NASCAR wannabe driver wouldn't be out drag-racing his friends, careening toward you at a high rate of speed. </p><p> No doubt about it--you live your life by faith every day, even in the mundane details. You may have what seem like good reasons for your faith, which is fine, but you could also be wrong about some of your conclusions. And some of those mistakes could be serious, even life-threatening. </p><p> Your beliefs--from your everyday beliefs to your beliefs about the ultimate purpose of life--are the source for how you live. </p><p> Many of us spend more time reading about which SUV we should buy or what clothes we should wear than we do on what beliefs we should hold. </p><p> Have you chosen your beliefs wisely? </p><p> In "Choosing Your Faith, " Mark Mittelberg helps you investigate the reasons why to believe--and why it matters so much.</p><p>Your Beliefs<br> Determine<br> How You Live. </p><p> HAVE YOU CHOSEN WISELY? </p><p> Do You Know<br> Why You Believe<br> What You Do? </p><p> Mark Mittelberg explores why our beliefs are so crucial for everyday life.

The mighty warship, which was bombed at Pearl Harbor by the Japanese on December 7, 1941, became and remains to this day a symbol and rallying point for America's sudden entrance into war.<br><br>Here, using eyewitness accounts of the bombing and the sinking, the authors narrate the compelling history of the USS <i>Arizona </i>before, during, and after the attack, and describe the <i>Arizona </i>Memorial's legacy today. This engrossing book includes sixteen pages of photographs and extensive interviews with sailors who survived Imperial Japan's attack. <i>The USS Arizona, </i>published on December 7, 2001, the sixtieth anniversary of the surprise attack, is the only full-length book on the great ship and its beautiful resting place. <br></p><p><p>"This is no drill! This is no drill! General Quarters! All hands! General Quarters! We're under attack!"</p><p>In the first terrifying moments of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the crew of the USS Arizona could not have imagined the horrors that awaited them on that "Day of Infamy," December 7, 1941. The battleship Arizona exploded when an armor-piercing bomb ignited its forward munitions, creating a thunderclap that rocked the skies; 1,177 men were killed on the Arizona-more than half the casualties at Pearl Harbor. The USS Arizona gives a riveting account of the terrible events that violently thrust America into World War II. From accounts of what it was like below deck and topside to its fiery aftermath, we see the attack unfold through the eyes of survivors. Accompanied by 16 pages of photographs, this stirring chronicle tells the story of the famous battleship as few other writers or historians have, detailing its construction, covering life on board the peacetime Arizona, and revealing the unshakeable bond its sailors shared with their ship. Most of all, The USS Arizona captures the ship's transformation into a potent symbol of American grit and resolve-a symbol that resonates today at the final resting place of the USS Arizona and the sailors and Marines who perished with her.</p><p>"The moment that will never leave my mind is when I walked up on the Navy landing and saw the Arizona. The Japanese were overhead, the Arizona was down and burning, the Nevada was under way, and I stood there and watched her go aground. The Oklahoma was upside down. I still see it." -Ralph D. Byard, Chief Commissary Steward</p><p>Praise for <i>The USS Arizona</i></p><p>"This book provides the human story of the tragedy in a most compelling way." -<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"The first-person accounts and the authors' lucid reconstruction of the Arizona's final hours are vividly cinematic and wholly absorbing.... A revealing glimpse into that other day that shook the world." -Edward Morris, <i>Bookpage</i></p></p><h2>Steam / its generation and use</h2><p>While the time of man&#39;s first knowledge and use of the expansive force of the vapor of water is unknown, records show that such knowledge existed earlier than 150 B.

His apothegm &#x201c;Cogito, ergo sum&#x201d; marked the birth of the mind-body problem, while his creation of so-called Cartesian coordinates has made our intellectual conquest of physical space possible.<br><br>But Descartes had a mysterious and mystical side, as well. Almost certainly a member of the occult brotherhood of the Rosicrucians, he kept a secret notebook, now lost, most of which was written in code. After Descartes&#x2019;s death, Gottfried Leibniz, inventor of calculus and one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, moved to Paris in search of this notebook&#x2013;and eventually found it in the possession of Claude Clerselier, a friend of Descartes&#x2019;s. Liebniz called on Clerselier and was allowed to copy only a couple of pages&#x2013;which, though written in code, he amazingly deciphered there on the spot. Liebniz&#x2019;s hastily scribbled notes are all we have today of Descartes&#x2019;s notebook.<br><br>Why did Descartes keep a secret notebook, and what were its contents? The answers to these questions will lead the reader on an exciting, swashbuckling journey, and offer a fascinating look at one of the great figures of Western culture.</p><p>AMIR D.

For like Julius Caesar crossing the Rubicon in 49 B.C., Jeanne Brochard crossed the Creuse River, which lay between her family home, in the region of Poitou, and the small town of La Haye, which lies in the region of Touraine, in western central France.<br><br>The Descartes family had originated in Poitou and had lived for many years in the town of Chatellerault, about twenty-five kilometers south of La Haye. Descartes' parents, Joachim Descartes and Jeanne Brochard, who were married on January 15, 1589, owned a stately mansion in the center of Chatellerault, at 126 rue Carrou-Bernard (today's rue Bourbon).<br><br>Joachim Descartes was the councillor of the Parliament of Brittany, and this important job kept him away in distant Rennes. Jeanne needed her mother's help in birthing the baby, and this is why she traveled north and across the river to Touraine to give birth to Renï¿½ Descartes in her mother's house in La Haye. Sometime later, once she had recovered, she returned to Chatellerault. Despite this accident of birth, throughout his life, Rene's friends would often call him Rene <i>le Poitevin</i>--Rene of Poitou.<br><br>The regions of Poitou and Touraine include pastoral farmlands that have been cultivated since antiquity. There are low hills, many of which are forested, and rich flatlands, irrigated by rivers that cut through this fertile land. Cows and sheep graze here, and many kinds of crops are grown. La Haye is a small town of stone houses with gray roofs. At the time of Descartes, the population of the town numbered about 750 people.<br><br>Chatellerault is a larger, more genteel town than La Haye, with wide avenues and an elegant city square, and it serves as the hub of rural life in the region. Because this part of France is so fertile and rich in water and agricultural resources, the people who live here are well off. North of La Haye one can still visit the beautiful chateaus of the Loire Valley, as well as forests and game reserves, which existed at the time of Descartes. The chateaus, many of them restored to their original state, with lavish fifteenth- and sixteenth-century furnishings and surrounded by sculpted gardens, give us a feel for the life of the rich at the time of Descartes.<br><br>While the regions of Poitou and Touraine are similar in their topography, scenery, and the way the towns and villages are laid out, there was one important difference between them. While Poitou was mainly Protestant, Touraine was mostly Catholic. We know that in the fifteen years from 1576 to 1591, there were only seventy-two Protestant baptisms in La Haye. This significant religious difference between the two regions would affect the life of Renï¿½ Descartes. For this accident of birth--being born, and later also raised, in a strongly Catholic region while his family hailed from a Protestant one--would exert a significant impact on Renï¿½'s personality, thus influencing his actions throughout his life and determining the course of development of his philosophical and scientific ideas and the way he divulged them to the world.<br><br>Descartes lived in a century that knew severe tensions, including wars, between Catholics and Protestants. The fact that he was born in a Catholic region and would be raised by a devout Catholic governess, while many of his family's friends and associates in Poitou were Protestants, contributed to Descartes' natural secretiveness. It also made him, as an adult, much more concerned about the Catholic Inquisition than perhaps he should have been, and not worried enough about the persecution he could face from Protestants. Consequently, Descartes would refrain from publishing elements of his science and philosophy for fear of the Inquisition, and yet would readily settle in Protestant countries, where academics and theologians would viciously attack his work in part because they knew he was a Catholic.<br><br>Renï¿½ Descartes was baptized a Catholic in Saint George's Chapel in La Haye, a twelfth-century Norman church, on April 3, 1596. His baptismal certificate reads:<br>This day was baptized Renï¿½, son of the noble man Joachym Descartes, councillor of the King and his Parliament of Brittany, and of damsel Jeanne Brochard. His godparents, noble Michel Ferrand, councillor of the King, lieutenant general of Chatellerault, and noble Renï¿½ Brochard, councillor of the King, judge magistrate at Poitiers, and dame Jeanne Proust, wife of monsieur Sain, controller of weights and measures for the King at Chatellerault.<br>[signed]<br>Ferrand&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jehanne Proust&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rene Brochard<br>Michel Ferrand, Renï¿½ Descartes' godfather, was his great-uncle--Joachim Descartes' uncle on his mother's side. Rene Brochard was the baby's grandfather, Jeanne Brochard's father. Jeanne's mother, Renï¿½ Descartes' grandmother, was Jeanne Sain. Her brother's wife was Jeanne (Jehanne) Proust.<br>***<br>The name La Haye comes from the French word <i>haie</i>, meaning hedge. Originally the town was named Haia, and in the eleventh century, as the language evolved, the spelling was changed to Haya. In Descartes' time it was called La Haye-en-Touraine. In 1802, the town's name was changed to La Haye-Descartes, in honor of the philosopher, and in 1967, "La Haye" was altogether dropped and the town is now known as Descartes.<br><br>There was once a castle in the area, and the wealthiest and most powerful citizens of La Haye lived in it. As the feudal system disintegrated, the castle was abandoned and the people moved down to the town, where they could live more comfortably. But life in this area remained difficult. People suffered both from wars and from disease. The plague ravaged La Haye and its surroundings several times in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. In 1607, the town was placed under quarantine after a recurrence of the plague killed many people in the area.<br><br>In early times, the hedges denoted by the French name Haia (or Haya or Haie) stood for thorny hedges that were planted by the townspeople in an effort to defend themselves and their property from marauding bands of brigands and highwaymen that pillaged and looted the countryside. But as times improved after the duke of Anjou took control of the area in September 1596--six months after the birth of Rene Descartes--the hedges implied by the name of the town came to mean hedges of beautiful gardens. To this day, this part of France is known for its exquisite gardens and areas of great natural beauty.<br><br>Late in life, just before he left on his final journey to Stockholm, Descartes wrote to his dearest friend, Princess Elizabeth: "A man who was born in the gardens of Touraine, shouldn't he avoid going to live in the land of the bears, between rocks and ice?" Descartes may well have been thinking of the garden of his own childhood home, his grandmother's house in La Haye, when he wrote these words to Elizabeth. Descartes' childhood home is an attractive two-story country house with four large rooms, although it is not nearly as impressive as the family mansion in Chatellerault. But it is surrounded by an exuberant garden, now restored to its original state, with flowers under the generous canopy of graceful trees. One can imagine the young boy enjoying many hours of undisturbed thinking and playing in this tranquil garden.<br>***<br>A year after Renï¿½ was born, shortly after giving birth to her fourth child, Jeanne Brochard died. The newborn survived for three more days, and then died too. Some of Descartes' biographers have written that Rene's personality was deeply affected by the loss of his mother, and have even speculated that the young boy blamed himself for her death because he did not quite understand--the event having taken place so close to his own birth--that she died sometime after giving birth to her <i>next </i>child.<br><br>After the death of his wife, Joachim remarried. He took a Breton woman named Anne Morin as his wife, and with her had another son and another daughter (and two other babies who died in infancy). They bought a house in Rennes, where Renï¿½'s older sister joined them in 1610, and where she got married in 1613 to a local man. Until then, Rene and his older brother and sister were raised by a governess. Rene Descartes was extremely attached to his governess, who was a devout Catholic. She lived to old age, and Descartes specified in his will that she was to receive a significant amount of money annually for her support.<br><br>As a child, Renï¿½ became known as the young philosopher of the family because he had a great curiosity about the world, always wanting to know why things were the way they were. The child grew up in the natural environment of farming and hunting and strolling in the woods. Throughout his life he would make references to the bucolic land of his birth and its natural rhythms. In letters to friends, and in published works, he would describe his childhood memories: the smell of the earth after a rainstorm; the trees at different seasons of the year; the process of fermentation of hay, and the making of new wine; the churning of butter from fresh milk; and the feel of the dust rising up from the earth as it was being plowed. Perhaps it was this early closeness to nature that kindled his interest in physics and mathematics as means for understanding nature and unraveling her secrets.<br><br>The Descartes family was wealthy, and Renï¿½ would inherit even more assets directly from his grandfathers on both sides, both of whom had been successful medical doctors. His great-grandfather Jean Ferrand had been the personal physician of Queen Eleanor of Austria, the wife of Francis I of France, in the middle of the sixteenth century. He attained great wealth, which was eventually passed on to his daughter Claude, who married Pierre Descartes. Their son was Joachim Descartes, ...</p><h2>The Engagement Plot</h2><p><b>Can Hanna and Will Find True Love amid the Bright Lights of Reality TV? </b><br><i>Perfect for the fans of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette!</i><br><br> Six months ago, William stole Hanna&#x2019;s heart and shattered it in front of millions of people on a reality TV dating show.

Tabory clearly instructs on how to "read" rips, bars, beaches, flats, jetties, reefs, tidal estuaries, and all other important fishing areas. He outlines what tackle fly fishermen will need, which flies are most effective (and when and how), how to hook and play these great northern gamefish.

It's a delightful book that will let you enjoy your garden's harvest all year long."--Carol Hupping, Editor of <i>Stocking Up III</i><br>ï¿½<br><br>CHAPTER ONE<br><br>A Guide to Harvesting Vegetables, Fruits, and Herbs<br><br>YOU'VE GOT your own garden, and that's great! Gardening provides fun, exercise, and, best of all, produce that you can use in hundreds of ways. You no longer need to be captive to the whims of the market--you can grow what you like best and eat it harvest-fresh, chemical-free, and untouched by additives. You can enjoy your favorite kinds of corn or beans as well as unusual things, such as Japanese pears or heirloom 'Moon and Stars' watermelons.<br><br>Growing your own produce lets you take charge of the harvesting process. Pick fruits and vegetables when their quality is at its very best and they have reached the right stage of maturity for eating, canning, freezing, or drying. Then, you don't have to lose any time getting the food from the ground into safekeeping.<br><br>Sometimes you can organize the garden so that produce will ripen when it is convenient for your use--and sometimes you can't. Most people can't control when their apples, berries, peaches, and pears will be mature. Once planted, fruit trees and berry plants will bear their fruit year after year when the time is right. You're at their mercy and must be prepared to harvest just when the pickings are ready if you want to get the fruit at its best.<br><br>Growing for Harvest<br><br>Vegetables are a different story. Because most are annuals and bear a certain number of weeks after they are planted, you can plan your garden to allow for succession plantings that extend the harvesting season and furnish you with a continuous supply of fresh food. This means that you can eat fresh vegetables over several smaller harvests if you wish (and the weather cooperates) and be able to preserve small batches as different waves of vegetables ripen.<br><br>Time your harvests so you pick each fruit and vegetable at perfection. Zucchini (top) that has been left on the vine too long is unfit for anything but puree. Tender young zucchini are perfect for fresh eating sliced in salads or stir-fries and make delicious pickles. Beets (bottom) left in the ground too long become tough and woody, but baby beets are at the ideal stage for canning, freezing, or pickling.<br><br>By planting three smaller crops of tomatoes instead of one large crop, you won't be deluged with more tomatoes than you can possibly eat and process at one time. Or you can space your three pea plantings ten days apart in early spring, and you'll have three harvests of peas and plenty of time to plant a later crop of something else in the same plots after you pick all the peas.<br><br>Plant vegetables that don't keep well, like salad greens, at least twice. Start with early lettuce about a month before the last frost and follow it with cauliflower. After the onions are out of the ground, put some fall lettuce in their place for September salads. If corn is one of your favorites and you've been waiting out the long winter for the first ears to come in, by all means, eat all the early-maturing corn you want. But make sure that you plant enough late corn for freezing later on.<br><br>Harvest as late as possible in fall when you grow vegetables that keep well in underground storage--crops like cabbage, potatoes, root crops, and squash. You won't have to worry about keeping vegetables cool during warm September and early October weather. Green and yellow beans, planted in early May, can be followed by cabbage in mid-July for a fall harvest. You can leave some vegetables, like parsnips and Jerusalem artichokes, right in the ground over the winter. So plant some late crops of these vegetables specifically for this purpose.<br><br>AN HEIRLOOM HARVEST<br><br>When you are looking for new crops for your garden or orchard, don't overlook heirloom fruits and vegetables. These are plants that have been passed down for generations by families and cultures around the world. Many have special qualities like different flavors, unique colors, or extra-long storage capacity. Most are open-pollinated, which means that the harvest time will vary somewhat and you will have fresh produce over a longer period of time. Browse through the small sampling of cultivars that follows to get a brief taste of what heirlooms are all about.<br><br>Heirloom Vegetables<br><br>. Beans, green: 'Blue Coco' snap bean, which originated in pre-1775 France, has purple pods and grows well in hot, dry weather.<br><br>. Beans, lima: 'Cliff Dweller' lima bean, from the ancient Apache culture, tolerates heat and drought and produces light-colored seeds splashed with dark highlights.<br><br>. Beets: 'Chioggia', an early Italian beet, is striped with alternating rings of red and white flesh.<br><br>. Carrots: 'Oxheart' carrot, introduced in 1884, grows short and thick, which makes it good for heavy soils and root-cellar storage.<br><br>. Eggplant: 'Turkish Italian Orange' eggplant, from Turkey, produces small, round, red-orange fruit that is mild and prolific.<br><br>. Lettuce: 'Oakleaf' lettuce, which originated in the 1800s, has handsome oak-shaped leaves with wavy margins. 'Rouge D'Hiver', a romaine lettuce from nineteenth-century France, has bronze leaves and solid heads. It thrives in cool and warm weather.<br><br>. Pumpkins: 'Small Sugar' pumpkin, a favorite of American pioneers from 1860, is sweet, firm, and tender, perfect for pies or any kind of cooking.<br><br>. Tomatoes: 'Big Rainbow' tomato, a mammoth-fruited plant from Minnesota, has green, yellow, and red skin and red-and-yellow-streaked flesh.<br><br>Heirloom Fruits<br><br>. Apples: 'Black Gilliflower', discovered in eighteenth-century Connecticut, ripens so dark red that it looks black. It's excellent for drying and cooking. 'Grosse Mignonne', sold as early as the mid - 1600s, has greenish white, extra-juicy fruit. 'Sauvignac', introduced in the mid- 1800s near Quebec City, Canada, is hardy to -50ï¿½F.<br><br>. Currants: 'White Imperial', brought to America in the late 1800s, has transparent white fruit and is more flavorful than any other currant.<br><br>. Pears: 'Seckel', grown in Europe since 1790, has small brown fruit with exceptional sweetness.<br><br>. Watermelons: 'Moon and Stars' watermelon, grown by the Amish for over 80 years, has red flesh and a green rind speckled with yellow stars and a large golden moon.<br><br>Handling the Harvest<br><br>One of the biggest advantages of growing your own produce--or picking it garden-fresh in a friend's yard--is that you can handle it with care. Then everything you pick at the moment of ideal ripeness will be perfect for preserving. You'll understand how important harvest treatment is when you know a little about what happens to fruits and vegetables after harvesting.<br><br>Once plucked from the plant, fruits and vegetables stop growing, but respiration and enzyme activities (which add up to aging) continue. The physical and chemical qualities deteriorate rapidly. As a result, appearance and flavor fade, and the nutrient content decreases, particularly fragile vitamin C.<br><br>WHERE TO FIND HEIRLOOM VEGETABLES AND FRUITS<br><br>To locate the long-lost tomato your grandmother used to grow or to browse for something different to try, check out the Garden Seed Inventory, published by the Seed Saver's Exchange. This 500-page volume lists thousands of different plants and gives brief descriptions and sources for each. A good resource for finding heirloom fruit cultivars is the Fruit, Berry and Nut Inventory, which lists all cultivars of fruiting trees and bushes available today, along with where to buy them. This 500-page book is also available through the Seed Saver's Exchange.<br><br>If you want to sample heirloom apples so you can decide which cultivars to grow, you can order a boxful from Applesource, 1716 Apple Road, Chapin, IL 62628 (applesource.com).<br><br>Catalogs That Specialize in Heirlooms<br><br>You may not be able to find heirloom vegetable seeds in garden centers, but these days they are showing up in large seed and nursery catalogs. You'll find an even bigger selection of cultivars in specialized heirloom catalogs such as the ones in the following list.

But despite our best intentions, distractions and delays are a part of life. If you find some of them getting in the way of your garden-to-storage routine, at least take precautions: Cool your food right after you pick it. Move foods into the refrigerator, except for tomatoes and basil.<br><br>Tomatoes and basil actually lose flavor or quality in low refrigerator temperatures. If you have more of these items than you can eat right away, process them immediately, while all the other vegetables and fruits are chilling. Or put the basil in a glass of water like cut flowers, and leave the tomatoes out of the sun on the kitchen counter for a few hours until you have time to deal with them.<br><br>Fruits and vegetables are at their best when you first pick them. And no storage technique, no matter how good it is, will make a great food out of so-so fruits or vegetables. The most that you can expect is to preserve most of the goodness that the food first started with. If you've taken the effort to grow good food, you owe it to yourself to make the extra effort to harvest it at the right time and get it into proper storage as soon as you can.<br><br>SOURCES OF MODERN GARDEN SEEDS<br><br>There are so many seed catalogs out there, it's hard to choose.

The preserve symbol refers to food made into jams and jellies.<br><br>Vegetable and Herb Harvesting Guide<br><br>Artichokes<br><br>Harvest artichokes when the buds are tender and full but the bracts are still closed. You've waited too long once the bracts turn purple and the flowers begin to form. Use pruning shears or a sharp knife to cut off the bud and 4 to 6 inches of the stem, which can be edible, too. You'll harvest the large central bud on each stem first. It will be followed by side buds if your growing season is long enough. Don't be surprised if your artichokes don't bloom the first year--they're perennials, so it takes them a while to get going. Even if they do, don't harvest until the second year to allow the plants time to establish themselves.<br><br>You can grow artichokes even if you live in a cold climate where perennial cultivars aren't hardy. Try 'Imperial Star', a high-yielding annual.<br><br>Asparagus<br><br>In cool climates, wait until the third year after planting to begin harvesting asparagus. But in warmer areas, you can harvest lightly the second year after planting. When tight-headed spears reach 6 to 10 inches tall, twist or cut them off just below soil level. On mature plantings, you can harvest for six to eight weeks in spring.<br><br>For high yields, grow 'Jersey Knight' and 'SYN 4-56' (formerly 'Jersey Giant'). Because these cultivars seldom include female plants, they can produce several times the number of spears of older cultivars. For warm climates, try 'UC 157'.<br><br>Basil<br><br>Keep basil flower heads pinched off for the most flavorful leaves. Pinch off shoot tips when you need a little basil. Or cut stems back by one-half their total length if you want to preserve some of this spicy herb.<br><br>SOURCES OF FRESH PRODUCE<br><br>If you don't have your own garden, or if you need to supplement what your garden grows, here are other ways to get ultrafresh produce.<br><br>. Place a special order with a local farm market. Have them pick a blend of fully or partly ripe items--as you request--early in the morning and you'll still have the day to preserve the food.<br><br>. Harvest at a pick-your-own organic orchard or garden. If you have several cultivars to choose from, ask which is best for the type of preserving you have in mind.<br><br>. Subscribe to Community-Supported Agriculture. For a fee, you'll get a regular supply of fresh produce and, maybe, rights to harvest produce.<br><br>. Ask gardening friends, relatives, and neighbors to call you if they anticipate overabundant harvests. Then you can pick what you need before it gets overgrown or aged.<br><br>. Support your local farmers' market. Find out which stalls actually grow what they sell and establish a good relationship with them. You might persuade them to let you know what produce they expect to have the following week so you are able to make plans for preserving accordingly.<br><br>. Put an ad in a school, church, or organization bulletin asking to share the costs and work of a garden for harvesting privileges.<br><br>Grow 'Dark Opal' basil for making red herb vinegars. With its showy purple leaves, it's attractive in your flower beds, too.<br><br>Beans, Dried<br><br>If you...</p><h2>Little Book of Big Emotions: How Five Feelings Affect Everything You Do (and Don&#39;t Do)</h2><p>Mad.

He is days away from his first visit back to Nice since he was a child, bringing with him a handful of puzzling photos he's discovered from his mother's wartime years. But he receives a call from social services: Noah is the closest available relative of an eleven-year-old great-nephew he's never met, who urgently needs someone to look after him. Out of a feeling of obligation, Noah agrees to take Michael along on his trip. <br> Much has changed in this famously charming seaside mecca, still haunted by memories of the Nazi occupation. The unlikely duo, suffering from jet lag and culture shock, bicker about everything from steak frites to screen time. But Noah gradually comes to appreciate the boy's truculent wit, and Michael's ease with tech and sharp eye help Noah unearth troubling details about their family's past. Both come to grasp the risks people in all eras have run for their loved ones, and find they are more akin than they knew.<br><br>Written with all the tenderness and psychological intensity that made <i>Room </i>an international bestseller, <i>Akin </i>is a funny, heart-wrenching tale of an old man and a boy, born two generations apart, who unpick their painful story and start to write a new one together.</p><p>Born in Dublin in 1969,<b> Emma Donoghue</b> is an Irish emigrant twice over: she spent eight years in Cambridge doing a PhD in eighteenth-century literature before moving to London, Ontario, where she lives with her French partner and their two children.Her fascination with Nice developed over the two years her family have spent in that city. <br> She also migrates between genres, writing literary history, biography, stage and radio plays as well as fairy tales and short stories.

The Red Feather project is extremely important; it is truly making a difference."&#x2014;Jane Goodall <p>For more than a decade the Red Feather Development Group, a volunteer-based organization, has built and repaired straw bale houses for Native Americans. Somewhere along the way&#x2014;and this was certainly not the plan&#x2014;they created an architectural phenomenon: This inexpensive, environmentally sound, easily constructed, and downright beautiful form of building has, for good reason, caught the public's imagination. Here, Red Feather provides a step-by-step, easy-to-follow manual for would-be strawbale builders&#x2014;indeed, they supply everything you'll need but time, energy, and lots and lots of straw. Informative sections on safety, design, tools, and materials, and case studies picked from over thirty-five Red Feather projects give a comprehensive overview to straw-bale building. </p><p>But this book is much more than a construction manual. It is also the inspiring story of Red Feather itself, a tale of community action and cooperation that suggests a can-do solution to the growing housing crisis on America's Native American reservations.</p></p><p>Nathaniel Corum is community design director for Red Feather Development Group.

And even though it bears the weight of two of the genre's most overused icons--a New Orleans setting and an ex-sports star as hero--<i>Crossroad Blues</i> is fresh and imaginative enough in all its other aspects to inspire hope for an ongoing series.<p> Yes, Nick Travers did play for the New Orleans Saints, but it wasn't an injury that turned him into a part-time detective and full-time expert on the blues. "Nick had been thrown out of the NFL for kicking his coach's ass during a Monday Night Football game," Atkins tell us. Now he teaches the occasional blues history class at Tulane, works on his biography of Guitar Slim, and plays his harmonica at JoJo's Blues Bar--a place so lovingly described that it should be real even if it isn't. When a Tulane colleague disappears on a quest for some hitherto unknown Johnson recordings in the Mississippi Delta town of Greenwood, Travers goes to look for him--and walks into a murderous mess of colorful sociopaths, including a deadly teenage Elvis lookalike and a slimy record producer who not only orchestrates violent crimes but also dares to use the blues as a marketing ploy for a chain of nightclubs.

Extensively researched in primary sources, Baptized in Blood is a significant and well-written study of the South&#x2019;s civil religion, one of two public faiths in America. In his comparison, Wilson finds the Lost Cause offered defeated Southerners a sense of meaning and purpose and special identity as a precarious but distinct culture. Southerners may have abandoned their dream of a separate political nation after Appomattox, but they preserved their cultural identity by blending Christian rhetoric and symbols with the rhetoric and imagery of Confederate tradition.<p> Civil religion&#x201d; has been defined as the religious dimension of a people that enables them to understand a historical experience in transcendent terms. In this light, Wilson explores the role of religion in postbellum southern culture and argues that the profound dislocations of Confederate defeat caused southerners to think in religious terms about the meaning of their unique and tragic experience. The defeat in a war deemed by some as religious in nature threw into question the South&#x2019;s relationship to God; it was interpreted in part as a God-given trial, whereby suffering and pain would lead Southerners to greater virtue and strength and even prepare them for future crusades. From this reflection upon history emerged the civil religion of the Lost Cause.</p><p>While recent work in southern religious history has focused on the Old South period, Wilson&#x2019;s timely study adds to our developing understanding of the South after the Civil War. The Lost Cause movement was an organized effort to preserve the memory of the Confederacy. Historians have examined its political, literary, and social aspects, but Wilson uses the concepts of anthropology, sociology, and historiography to unveil the Lost Cause as an authentic expression of religion. The Lost Cause was celebrated and perpetuated with its own rituals, mythology, and theology; as key celebrants of the religion of the Lost Cause, Southern ministers forged it into a religious movement closely related to their own churches.</p><p>In examining the role of civil religion in the cult of the military, in the New South ideology, and in the spirit of the Lost Cause colleges, as well as in other aspects, Wilson demonstrates effectively how the religion of the Lost Cause became the institutional embodiment of the South&#x2019;s tragic experience.</p></p><p>Charles Reagan Wilson is Kelly Gene Cook, Sr., Chair in History and Professor of Southern Studies at the University of Mississippi.

Wilson's magnificent book on the religion of the Lost Cause drives that point home forcefully. . . .

She is also the author of the bestselling In Death series written under the pen name J. D. Robb. There are more than 400 million copies of her books in print.Chapter One<br><br> For an instant, like a single beat of wings, Annika scented the sea, heard the voices lifted in song. Here then gone, a blur within the blur of color and speed, but it swelled in her heart like love.<br><br> Then came a sigh, and the echoes of sighs, another kind of music. Bittersweet. And this washed through her like tears.<br><br> So with joy and sorrow mated in her heart, she fell. Tumbling, spiraling, spinning in a breathless rush that added a reckless thrill and a quick panic.<br><br> A thousand wings beat now, a thousand and a thousand more, with whipping wind, a wall of sound. And color flicked away into the dark as she landed abruptly enough to lose her breath.<br><br> For a moment she feared they'd landed in some deep, dark cave where spiders would crawl, and worse, much worse, where Nerezza waited to strike.<br><br> Then her vision cleared. She made out shadows, what she knew as moonlight, and felt the firm body beneath hers, the arms wrapped tight around her. She knew that shape, that scent, wanted to snuggle right in, Nerezza or not.<br><br> It was a wonder, a star-struck sea of wonder, to feel his heart beat, so fast and strong, against hers.<br><br> Then he shifted a little, and one hand slid up, then down her hair. The other skimmed wonderfully over her bottom.<br><br> She snuggled right in.<br><br> "Um." Both hands came to her shoulders now, but his voice spoke close enough to her heart that his breath tickled it. "Are you okay? Are you hurt? Everybody okay?"<br><br> She remembered her friends-not that she'd forgotten them, not ever. But she'd never lain so intimately on a man before-on Sawyer-and she liked it very, very much.<br><br> She heard grunts, short groans, some cursing. Doyle's voice, close by and annoyed, clearly said, "Fuck me," which she knew wasn't an invitation to mate, but an oath.<br><br> She didn't worry about Doyle. After all, he was an immortal.<br><br> "Sound off." That was Bran, somewhere a few feet away. "Did everybody make it? I've got Sasha. Riley?"<br><br> "What a ride!"<br><br> "One you finished with your knee in my balls," Doyle added.<br><br> Annika heard a thump, which she interpreted as Doyle shoving Riley and her knee aside-as balls, she'd learned, weren't just the round toy that bounced, but a man's sensitive area.<br><br> "I'm here," she called out, and experimented by wiggling a little on Sawyer's sensitive area. "Did we fall out of the sky?"<br><br> "Not far from it." Sawyer cleared his throat and, to Annika's disappointment, shifted again and sat up. "I couldn't slow it down. I've never taken six people this far. I misjudged, I guess."<br><br> "We're here, the six of us, and that's first on the list," Bran stated. "Now, are we where we aimed to be?"<br><br> "We're inside," Sasha commented. "I can see windows, and moonlight through them. Wherever we are, it's still night."<br><br> "Let's hope Sawyer and his time- and space-bending compass got us where and when we want. So let's find out."<br><br> Riley pushed to her feet. The scientist-archaeologist. Annika rolled the word in her mind as her people, the merpeople, had nothing to compare. They had no lycans either, she thought, so nothing and no one quite like Riley existed in Annika's world.<br><br> Dr. Riley Gwin-tough, compact body, wide-brimmed hat that had somehow stayed on her head-strode to the window.<br><br> "I can see water, but not the view from the villa on Corfu-we're higher up. A road, steep, narrow. We've got steps leading down to it. I'm pretty sure this is Capri, and this is the villa. Bull's-eye, Sawyer. Kudos to the traveler and his magic compass."<br><br> "I'll take them." He stood, hesitated, then held out a hand to help Annika up. Though her legs were strong and agile, she let him.<br><br> "Let me see if I can find the lights," Riley began.<br><br> "I can help with that."<br><br> Bran, on his feet, an arm around Sasha, held out his hand. The ball of light hovering over his palm illuminated the room.<br><br> Seeing her friends lifted her heart as the song had. Sasha, the seer, with her hair like the sun and her eyes of the sky, and Bran, the sorcerer, so handsome with his magick lighting him. And Riley, one hand on the butt of the gun on her hip-at the ready-her dark gold eyes looking everywhere at once as Doyle, a warrior through and through, stood with his sword already drawn.<br><br> And Sawyer, always Sawyer, with the compass of the traveler in his hand.<br><br> They might be bruised and bloodied from the last battle, but they were safe and together.<br><br> "Is this our home now?" she wondered. "It's very pretty."<br><br> "Unless Sawyer dropped us at the wrong address, I say this is the new HQ." Though her hand stayed on her gun, Riley moved from the window.<br><br> The room had colorful cushions on a long bed-no, Annika reminded herself, a sofa. And chairs and tables with pretty lamps. The floor-they all had reason to know-was hard, with large tiles the color of sun-beaten sand.<br><br> Riley moved to one of the lamps, turned the switch and, with the magic of electricity, it lit.<br><br> "Let me get my bearings, make sure we're in the right place. We don't want a visit from the polizia."<br><br> Riley moved out of the room through a wide, arched opening. In seconds, more light poured through. Sheathing his sword, Doyle moved out after her.<br><br> "Here's all our stuff, at least it looks like all of it. And it looks like it had a softer landing than we did."<br><br> Annika peeked out. She didn't know what to call the space with its big door facing the sea, and the archways leading to other spaces. But their bags and boxes sat in a pile in the center of it.<br><br> And with a muttered curse, Doyle heaved his motorcycle upright.<br><br> "I had to drop the stuff first so we didn't end up landing on it," Sawyer said. "Bull's-eye or not, Riley?"<br><br> "It fits the description I got," Riley went on. "And the location. There's supposed to be a large living area with glass doors leading to a . . . And here we go."<br><br> More lights, and as Riley said, a large room with more of the sofas and chairs and pretty little things. But best, oh, best of all, the wide, wide glass to bring in the sky and sea.<br><br> When Annika rushed forward to open the glass, Riley stayed her hand.<br><br> "Don't. Not yet. There's an alarm system. I have the code. We need to turn it off before we open this, or anything else."<br><br> "Panel's right here," Sawyer told her, and tapped it.<br><br> "Give me a sec." Riley dug a piece of paper out of her pocket. "Didn't want to trust my memory in case the trip scrambled my brains."<br><br> "Shifting doesn't scramble brains." Grinning, Sawyer knocked his knuckles on Riley's head as she keyed in the code.<br><br> "Go ahead and open it, Annika."<br><br> When she did, she twirled out onto a wide terrace, where there was night and moon, sea and the scent of it all, all perfumed with lemons and flowers.<br><br> "It's beautiful! I've never seen it from so high."<br><br> "But you've seen it before?" Sawyer asked her. "Capri?"<br><br> "From the sea. And beneath, where there are blue caves and deep water and the bones of ships that sailed long ago. There are flowers!" She reached out to touch the petals of flowers spilling out of hefty pots in bright colors. "I can water and tend them. It can be my job."<br><br> "Deal. This is the place." With a satisfied nod, Riley set her hands on her hips. "Kudos again, Sawyer."<br><br> "We should check through it in any case." Bran stood at the opening, dark, intense eyes scanning the sky.<br><br> Nerezza often came from the sky.<br><br> "I'll be adding protection over the more usual alarm system," he continued. "We caused her pain, and harm, so it's unlikely she'll gather herself enough to come at us again tonight, if indeed she can find us. But we'll sleep better with a layer of magick over all."<br><br> "Split up." With his sword sheathed, his dark hair tumbled around his hard, handsome face, Doyle nodded agreement. "Go through the place, make certain it's clear and secured."<br><br> "Should be two bedrooms down here, four more upstairs, and another common space. It's not big and plush like the villa, and we won't have all that outdoor space."<br><br> "Or Apollo," Annika put in.<br><br> "Yeah." Riley smiled. "I'm going to miss that dog. But there's room, and it's well located. I'll take the upstairs."<br><br> "You just want first call on the bedrooms."<br><br> Riley grinned at Sasha, then frowned. "You okay, Sash? You're pale."<br><br> "Just a headache. A regular headache," she said when all eyes turned to her. "I don't try to fight the visions anymore. It's just been a very long day."<br><br> "And so it has." Bran drew her close to his side, whispered something in her ear that made her smile and nod. "We'll take upstairs as well," he said, and with Sasha, vanished.<br><br> "Oh, cheat! No fair using magick!" Riley charged toward the steps and up.<br><br> "Three up, so three down to clear this floor. I'd sooner bunk down here," Doyle said with a look around, "closer to the outside access."<br><br> "You and me down here then," Sawyer decided-to Annika's disappointment. "Closer to the kitchen and the food. Let's see what we've got."<br><br> The two bedrooms stood side by side. Not as big as the ones they'd left behind on Corfu, but with nice beds and pretty views from the windows.<br><br> "Works," Doyle stated.<br><br> "Works," Sawyer agreed after opening another door to a bathroom with a shower.<br><br> The door slid in and out of the wall, delighting Annika so she had to push it in, pull it out a few times before Sawyer grabbed her hand and pulled her away.<br><br> They found another room with what Sawyer called a bar, a big television on the wall (she loved television), and a large table where colorful balls stood in a triangle on a green top.<br><br> Annika stroked her hand over the top. "It isn't grass."<br><br> "Felt," Sawyer told her. "It's a pool table-a game. You play?" he asked Doyle.<br><br> "What man who's lived a few centuries hasn't played pool?"<br><br> "I've only lived a few decades, but I've played my share. We'll have to have a game."<br><br> There was a powder room-though no one powdered anything in them that Annika had seen-and then the kitchen and eating area. She knew immediately Sawyer was pleased.<br><br> He wandered through it. A tall, lean body that moved, she thought, as if never hurried. Her fingers wanted to brush through all the dark gold hair the sun had streaked, shaggy and windblown from the traveling. And eyes, gray like the sea in the first silver light of dawn, that made her want to sigh.<br><br> "The Italians understand cooking-and eating. This is excellent."<br><br> She knew something about cooking now, had even learned to make a few dishes, so she recognized the big stove with its many burners, and the ovens for baking and roasting. A center island held its own sink, which charmed her, and another sink-wider-stood under a window.<br><br> Sawyer opened the box that kept things cold-the refrigerator, she remembered. "Already stocked. Riley doesn't miss a trick. Beer?"<br><br> "Oh, absolutely," Doyle said.<br><br> "Anni?"<br><br> "I don't like the beer very much. Is there something else?"<br><br> "Got your soft drinks, some fruit juice. And wait." He pointed up to a rack holding bottles. "Wine."<br><br> "I like the wine."<br><br> "Got you covered then." He chose a bottle, passed a beer to Doyle, took one for himself, then wandered to a door. "Pantry, also stocked. We're in business."<br><br> He opened drawers until he found the tool to open the wine. Corkscrew-such a funny word.<br><br> "I don't know about anybody else, but I'm starved. Shifting that many that far, it hulls you out."<br><br> "I could eat," Doyle decided.<br><br> "I'm going to throw something together. Riley was right, Sasha looks pale. We'll eat, drink, decompress."<br><br> "Have at it then. I'm going to check outside." With his sword still sheathed on his back, Doyle went through another wide glass door.<br><br> "I can help you make the food."<br><br> "Don't you want to grab up a bedroom?"<br><br> "I like to help make the food." With you, most of all, she thought.<br><br> "Okay, let's keep it simple. Quick pasta, tossed with butter and herbs. And we've got . . . yeah, we've got tomatoes, mozzarella." He pulled the cheese from the refrigerator, handed her a tomato from the bowl on the counter. "You remember how to slice these up?"<br><br> "Yes, I can slice very well."<br><br> "You slice them up, then find a plate or tray or platter." He spread his hands to show her size.<br><br> He had strong hands, but was gentle with them. Annika thought gentleness was its own kind of strength.<br><br> "And you lay them out with the cheese on top of the tomato," he continued, so she knew to pay attention. "Drizzle this olive oil over them." He set a container on the counter.<br><br> "Drizzle is like rain, but only a little."<br><br> "You got it. Then you're going to take this." He walked over to the windowsill, where some pots sat, and broke off a stem with leaves. "It's basil."<br><br> "I remember. It adds flavor."<br><br> "Yeah. Chop it up some, sprinkle it over everything, grind a little pepper on there, too, and that's a wrap."<br><br> "It's a wrap."<br><br> "It's finished," he explained.<br><br> "I will wrap it for you."<br><br> Pleased, she braided her waist-length black hair back and away. She got to work while he put a pot of water on the stove, poured her wine, drank his beer.<br><br> She liked the quiet times with him, and had learned to savor them. There would be more fighting; she knew, accepted. There would be more pain. She would accept that, too. But she had been given a gift. The legs that allowed her to walk out of the sea and onto land, if only for a short time. The friends who were more precious than gold. The purpose that was her legacy and her duty.<br><br> And most of all, Sawyer, whom she'd loved before he even knew she existed.<br><br> "Do you dream, Sawyer?"<br><br> "What?" Distracted, he glanced back at her as he found a colander. "Sure. Sure, most everybody does."<br><br> "Do you dream of when we've done our duty, when we have all three stars? When the Stars of Fortune are safe from Nerezza? When there is no more fighting?"</p><h2>Cabin Creek Mysteries #1: The Secret of Robber&#39;s Cave</h2><p>Action! Intrigue! Cliff-hangers!

His investigation convinced him that Britain was covered with a vast network of straight tracks, aligned with either the sun or the path of a star.<br><br>Although traces of this network can be found all over the country, the principles behind the ley system remain a mystery. Are they the legacy of a prehistoric scientific knowledge which is now all but lost? And was their purpose secular or religious?</p><p>Alfred Watkins was born in Hereford in 1855 and was an enthusiastic early photographer, the inventor of much apparatus, including the pinhole camera and the Watkins exposure meter. His revelation took place when he was 65 and caused violent controversy in archeological circles.** &#39;A remarkable book... it will not be long before Alfred Watkins is recognised for what he was, an honest visionary who saw beyond the bounds of his time.&#39; JOHN MITCHELL, author of THE VIEW OVER ATLANTIS</p><h2>The Birds, and Other Stories</h2><p>How long he fought with them in the darkness he could not tell, but at last the beating of the wings about him lessened and then withdrew ...&#39; A classic of alienation and horror, &#39;The Birds&#39; was immortalised by Hitchcock in his celebrated film. The five other chilling stories in this collection echo a sense of dislocation and mock man&#39;s sense of dominance over the natural world. The mountain paradise of &#39;Monte Verita&#39; promises immortality, but at a terrible price; a neglected wife haunts her husband in the form of an apple tree; a professional photographer steps out from behind the camera and into his subject&#39;s life; a date with a cinema usherette leads to a walk in the cemetery; and a jealous father finds a remedy when three&#39;s a crowd ...</p><p>Daphne du Maurier (1907-89) was born in London, the daughter of the famous actor-manager Sir Gerald du Maurier and granddaughter of George du Maurier, the author and artist. In 1931 her first novel, The Loving Spirit, was published. A biography of her father and three other novels followed, but it was the novel Rebecca that launched her into the literary stratosphere and made her one of the most popular authors of her day. In 1932, du Maurier married Major Frederick Browning, with whom she had three children.Many of du Maurier&#39;s bestselling novels and short stories were adapted into award-winning films, including Alfred Hitchcock&#39;s The Birds and Nicolas Roeg&#39;s Don&#39;t Look Now. In 1969 du Maurier was awarded a DBE.

But in the summer of 2000, Michael found himself standing trial for the murder of his pregnant wife, Leann. The verdict--guilty of second-degree murder--would leave friends, family, and the public at large scrambling to make sense of a twisted and frightening series of events that ended in the brutal killing of Leann Fletcher. What could possibly have led Michael Fletcher to commit such a gruesome act?</p><p>As a college student, Michael Fletcher married the girl of his dreams after a three-year courtship. It seems like a fairy-tale romance come true: a match made in heaven. So why would a man with no history of domestic violence murder his devoted wife right after he told her how much he loved her? Why would Michael shoot Leann in the back of the head, not only killing her but also the child that she was carrying inside her? According to prosecutors, Fletcher has been involved in an extramarital affair with a beautiful judge for two years. Was his relationship with respected District Judge Susan Chrzanowski enough cause for him to murder his wife in cold blood? Raising even more troubling questions, the startling discovery colored Leann's already shocking murder with shadings of sex, political scandal, and deadly betrayal.</p></p><p><p><b>Tom Henderson</b>, a native of Michigan, has worked as a news reporter for many years.

Discovered by his estate, Orpheus Emerged chronicles the passions, conflicts and dreams of a group of bohemians searching for truth while studying at a university.Kerouac wrote the story shortly after meeting Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs, Lucien Carr, and others in and around Columbia University who would form the core of the Beats. Orpheus Emerged is a unique portrait of an artist as a young man and shows a writer in the process of finding the voice that would eventually express the spirit of a generation. The book comes with a CD-Rom (Win/Mac compatible) of the critically acclaimed and bestselling ebook version, which includes rare photographs of Kerouac, an audio reading, documentary video, and hundreds of interactive links, all offering a window into the world of Kerouac.</p><p>2 1.5-hour cassettesJack Kerouac is one of the most popular and influential writers in American literature.

He was the first person to climb all fourteen of the world&#x2019;s 8,000-meter peaks, many of them solo. Climber, writer, photographer, and filmmaker, Messner has published more than thirty books. His most recent is<i> My Quest for the Yeti.</i><br>The author has had a lifelong obsession with George Mallory's three attempts to, in his hero's own words, "catch the summit by surprise" in 1921, 1922 and on the 1924 quest from which he never returned. In this homage, Messner (My Quest for the Yeti) draws from Mallory's own journal entries to relive those three expeditions, fleshing them out for the reader with his own heroic experiences in climbing Everest. Avid mountaineers will be especially intrigued by the step-by-step detail Messner shares, enabling his readers to see the mountain as Mallory did. What is even more important to Messner is to celebrate Mallory's legacy and "the disappearance of the spirit of amateurism that drove him." Although he believes that Mallory never reached Everest's summit, Messner is adamant that all who came after this pioneer owe him a great debt. Employing Mallory's spirit, the author recounts subsequent expeditions, imagining what Mallory would say about each: the 1933 trip by Wager and Harris, who found an ice ax that could have been left behind only by Mallory or his colleague Irvine nine years before; Hillary and Tensing's triumphant climb in 1953; the expedition sponsored by the Chinese government in 1960 and the subsequent trek in 1975, which was the first time that "artificial climbing aids" (in contrast to Mallory's tweed jacket, hobnailed boots and a book by Keats) were used and have been so ever since; and, finally, the 1999 expedition during which Mallory's remains were found and ceremoniously buried. This tribute will resonate most strongly with veteran climbers, but even armchair enthusiasts will be gripped by Messner's seductive and uplifting narrative. 30 b&amp;w photos; 6 maps. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Karen&#39;s Worst Day (Baby-Sitters Little Sister, No. 3)</h2><p>Karen&#39;s bad day begins when she falls out of bed and ends with her in tears so she is only mildly surprised to find she holds a family record for bad things happening in one day</p><p></p><h2>Holding the Line: Women in the Great Arizona Mine Strike of 1983</h2><p><p><em>Holding the Line</em>, Barbara Kingsolver's first non-fiction book, is the story of women's lives transformed by an a signal event. Set in the small mining towns of Arizona, it is part oral history and part social criticism, exploring the process of empowerment which occurs when people work together as a community. Like Kingsolver's award-winning novels, <em>Holding the Line</em> is a beautifully written book grounded on the strength of its characters.</p><p>Hundreds of families held the line in the 1983 strike against Phelps Dodge Copper in Arizona. After more than a year the strikers lost their union certification, but the battle permanently altered the social order in these small, predominantly Hispanic mining towns. At the time the strike began, many women said they couldn't leave the house without their husband's permission. Yet, when injunctions barred union men from picketing, their wives and daughters turned out for the daily picket lines. When the strike dragged on and men left to seek jobs elsewhere, women continued to picket, organize support, and defend their rights even when the towns were occupied by the National Guard. "Nothing can ever be the same as it was before," said Diane McCormick of the Morenci Miners Women's Auxiliary. "Look at us. At the beginning of this strike, we were just a bunch of ladies."</p></p><p>Several mining towns have grown up around the rich Morenci copper pit in southern Arizona, each ruled to a certain extent by the Phelps Dodge Copper Corporation. In 1983, the company tried to freeze wages and deny the miners cost-of-living protection. The resulting strike lasted a long and miserable 18 months; management ultimately won its bid to have the union decertified but its business was damaged in the process, and the strikers took some comfort in a series of legal victories that, suggesting a discriminatory pattern of law enforcement, kept the labor activists out of jail. Journalist and novelist Kingsolver (The Bean Trees) has written a stirring partisan account of the role the area&#x2019;s women played in holding the strike and in keeping families and communities together, despite the strike&#x2019;s failure. The women tell remarkable stories of their lives and actions, displaying the strength that led one corporate official to remark, "If we could just get rid of these broads, we&#x2019;d have it made." This book pays powerful tribute to their resolve and passion for economic justice.<br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.In 1983, after the Phelps Dodge Copper Corporation demanded an unprecedented amount of pay and benefits cuts, a union consortium, consisting of mostly Hispanic women, held a strike in four small Arizona mining towns. The women's lives were transformed. Their culture had confined them to limited roles; they now became leaders, strategists, spokespersons, and morale-boosters. The first-person narratives of these women dominate this account of the 18-month strike, written by novelist Kingsolver, author of The Bean Trees (LJ 2/1/88) and Homeland and Other Stories ( LJ 5/15/89). While this format is interesting, fewer quotations and additional industry and strike background would have made the account more effective. Despite these reservations, the book will interest readers of labor studies, women's studies, and community/ethnic studies.<br><i>- Frieda Shoenberg Rozen, Pennsylvania State Univ., University Park</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>War of the Wolf</h2><p>Please Read Notes: Brand New, International Softcover Edition, Printed in black and white pages, minor self wear on the cover or pages, Sale restriction may be printed on the book, but Book name, contents, and author are exactly same as Hardcover Edition.

He is far less well known for his pioneering studies in ancient Greek history, which were an important influence on his most celebrated student, Friedrich Nietzsche, and which shaped the modernist view of Greek civilization not as an expression of the heights of human reason, but as an irrational and often dangerous construct. Burckhardt believed that the ancient Greeks' myth-laden view of their own past, full of sociopathic heroes and tragic victims, was an expression of this state of unreason: "The wildest variations and contradictions," he writes, "were not found at all disturbing."<p> Even less disturbing to the Greeks, he continues, was the systematic violence--and even human sacrifice--that erupted when a city like Athens wished to extend its territory or when a leader wished to extend his power. That violence, Burckhardt holds, was a natural result of the ancient Greeks' pursuit of honor, which accrued by facing and defeating danger. One such danger was the mere act of standing out in any way whatever, which could net a would-be hero a charge of being impious--witness, Burckhardt notes, the fates of Socrates and his contemporary Alcibiades. Drawing from examples of mythology, tragedy, oratory, and comedy, Burckhardt touches on themes such as Greek society's contempt for women and its apparent readiness to embrace all sorts of antidemocratic demagoguery--in the person, for instance, of the famed hero Lysander, who "combines depravity with natural gifts in a way that was typically Spartan and yet generally Greek." Burckhardt's deconstruction of classical history, ably edited by Oxford historian Oswyn Murray, reads as if it were written in our own time. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>"[Burckhardt] offers page after page of deeply interesting observations and anecdotes...[He] appraises the changing aspects of Greek civilization with cool even-handedness, dispassionately seeking to understand rather than judge or extol." --Michael Dirda, <i>The Washington Post Book World</i><p> "Not only a rich overview of Burckhardt's learning but a precious glimpse into the intellectual world of the late nineteenth century." --<i>The New Yorker</i></p><p> "A corrective to the rather gaga idealism of 'the Greek spirit'...lively." --George Wills, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p> "This book will become a necessary tool in courses not only on nineteenth-century historiography, but on the ancient world as well." --<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p></p><h2>Tormenting Thoughts and Secret Rituals: The Hidden Epidemic of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</h2><p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder has been called the "hidden epidemic": only a very few of the many people who have it reveal their condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian Osborn is one of those who suffers from OCD, and his personal experience imbues this book with an exceptional clarity and understanding.<br><br>Dr. Osborn discusses the various forms OCD takes and--using the most common focuses of obsession--presents detailed and dramatic cases whose objects are filth, harm, lust, and blasphemy.&nbsp;&nbsp;He explains how the disorder is currently diagnosed, and how it differs from addiction, worrying, and preoccupation.&nbsp;&nbsp;He summarizes the recent findings in the areas of brain biology, neuroimaging, and genetics that show OCD to be a distinct chemical disorder of the brain.&nbsp;&nbsp;He contrasts OCD with other "OCD spectrum disorders" such as anorexia nervosa and hairpulling, and he provides a historical overview that traces the development over the centuries of both behavior therapy and medications.</p><p>"Dr. Osborn has written a splendid book on OCD--lively, lucid, informative, and scholarly.

An elegantly written memoir and meditation, the book explores the many paths of enlightenment available to readers looking beyond today's churches, temples, and synagogues.</p><p>Author Paul Rademacher, a former minister, found that too often church focused too much on eternity&#x2014;what happens when we die. With this book, he shows that the rightful focus of any true spiritual path is on infinity&#x2014;how to experience eternity, the fullness of our divinity, in the here and now. Rademacher has written a deeply personal book that often uses biblical texts as a jumping-off point to explore enlightenment outside of any traditional religious institution.

Over the past five centuries, a rotating cast of kings and conquerors, presidents and dictators have set their sights on the European heartland, desperate to seize this pivotal area or at least prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. From Charles V and Napoleon to Bismarck and Cromwell, from Hitler and Stalin to Roosevelt and Gorbachev, nearly all the key power players of modern history have staked their titanic visions on this vital swath of land. <br><br>In <i>Europe</i>, prizewinning historian Brendan Simms presents an authoritative account of the past half-millennium of European history, demonstrating how the battle for mastery there has shaped the modern world. Beginning in 1453, when the collapse of the Byzantine Empire laid Europe open to Ottoman incursion and prompted the dramatic expansion of the Holy Roman Empire, Simms leads readers through the epic struggle for the heart of Europe. Stretching from the Low Countries through Germany and into the North Italian plain, this relatively compact zone has historically been the richest and most productive on earth. For hundreds of years, its crucial strategic importance stoked a seemingly unending series of conflicts, from the English Civil War to the French Revolution to the appalling world wars of the 20th century. But when Europe is in harmony, Simms shows, the entire world benefits&#x2014;a lesson that current leaders would do well to remember. <br><br>A bold and compelling work by a renowned scholar, <i>Europe</i> integrates religion, politics, military strategy, and international relations to show how history&#x2014;and Western civilization itself&#x2014;was forged in the crucible of Europe.<br><br></p><p>Brendan Simms is a fellow at Peterhouse College, Cambridge, professor in the History of European International Relations, and Director of the Centre of International Studies, University of Cambridge. The author of five books, including <i>Three Victories and a Defeat</i> and <i>Unfinest Hour</i>, which was short-listed for the Samuel Johnson Prize, he lives in Cambridge, England.<br><b><i>BBC History Magazine</i></b><br> Brilliantly successful .Simms has the breadth of knowledge and clarity of vision to make his case compelling. His book is also immensely entertaining as well as instructive. There are few pages not enlivened by sharp insight, telling vignette or memorable turn of phrase. In short, this is a great book and everyone interested in European history will want to read it.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>The Washington Times</i></b><br> [A] sweeping, intelligent and enormously ambitious book.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Paul Kennedy, J. Richardson Dilworth Professor of History, Yale University, and author of <i>The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers</i></b><br> <i>Europe</i> is a superb, sure-footed analysis of how this center of world civilization, technology, and warfare evolved since the fall of Constantinople in 1453. It is unabashedly political history, and the better for being so. Simms's acumen and sharp opinions are a joy to read. This book will be appreciated both by the general reader and by history teachers everywhere.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br> Prodigious .If postmodern scholarship has Ranke spinning in his grave, Mr. Simms's book will give his weary soul some rest . This is the history of Richelieu, Metternich and Kissinger, not of Luther, Newton and Beethoven. Such a summary may sound arid, but <i>Europe</i> is anything but. In fact, it draws the reader forward with its grand epic of shifting alliances, clashing armies and ambitious statecraft. Simms is a skilled writer with a rare gift for compressed analysis. His focus on the military and diplomatic arc of European history lends his book a strong narrative line and thematic coherence. Patterns emerge that might have remained buried in a more various survey.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Economist</i>, Favorite Book of the Year</b><br> An original take on Europe's history that shows that German power was a concern long before the country formally came into being in the late 19th century, and perhaps as far back as the mid-1400s.

He has, in effect, dropped a big stone into the European pond and stood back to watch the ripples spread . It is a compelling and provocative thesis . This is sweeping history, told with verve and panache, and it is all the more refreshing for that.&#x201d;<br><br><i><b>Financial Times</b></i><br> <i>Europe</i> is a stimulating, impressive history that starts with the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453 and extends to the present day .An excellent read and its insights into the grand themes of European history are penetrating and lucidly argued.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>The Telegraph</i></b><br>"Brendan Simms is a historian of unusual range and ability.... His new book is nothing less than a history of Europe over the past 550 years.... Writing such a book is a colossally demanding task the sort of challenge most sane historians would baulk at, unless they had a very clear idea of what they wanted to say. Luckily, knowing what he wants to say is one of Simms's strengths. For this book is driven by two great master-ideas, and there is hardly a page in it where their presence is not felt. So, no matter how dense the details may be of kings, wars, treaties and governments, the reader always has the exhilarating sense of moving swiftly onwards.... Like all truly powerful and original works, this is a book worth disagreeing with.

A past president of Western Writers of America, Coldsmith wrote more than 40 books, as well as hundreds of newspaper and magazine articles. His "Spanish Bit Saga", a series of related novels, helped to re-define the Western novel by adopting the point of view of the Native Americans, rather than the European immigrants.In addition to his career as a writer, Coldsmith was a medical doctor, serving as a family practitioner in Emporia, Kansas, until 1988, when he chose to concentrate on writing. In addition, Coldsmith and his 2nd wife Edna were cattle ranchers and breeders of Appaloosa horses.Coldsmith, who had periodically taught English classes at Emporia State University, was awarded the Western Writers of America's Golden Spur Award for best original paperback for The Changing Wind of 1990. Other honors include Distinguished Kansan (awarded by the Native Sons and Daughters of Kansas in 1993) and the Edgar Wolfe Award for lifetime contributions to literature (1995). Coldsmith was in high demand as a speaker, especially when the subject was the High Plains and the American West.&#34;I&#39;ve been waiting for Moon of Madness to be published for several years. Moon of Madness is the last and final book in the Spanish Bit Saga series. There will be no more. Author Don Coldsmith passed away in 2009. This book was written before his passing. His wife has been trying to get this last book published for several years according to one website. It looks like she suceeded. I have all of the other books in the series. I am especially looking forward to reading this one due to the reference in the book to the New Madrid earthquake which ocurred within 200 miles of where I live. Farewell my friend.

For every princess there's a prince. The King has ultimate power. Stepmothers should never be trusted. And bad things come to those who break with Tradition....<br><br>But when Rosa is pursued by a murderous huntsman and then captured by dwarves, her beliefs go up in smoke. Determined to escape and save her kingdom from imminent invasion, she agrees to become the subject of one of her stepmother's risky incantations&#x2014;thus falling into a deep, deep sleep.<br><br>When awakened by a touchy-feely stranger, Rosa must choose between Tradition and her future between a host of eligible princes and a handsome, fair-haired outsider. And learn the difference between being a princess and ruling as a Queen.</p><p>New York Times bestselling author Mercedes Lackey has written over one hundred titles and has no plans to slow down.&nbsp;Known best for her tales of Valdemar and The Five Hundred Kingdoms, she's also a prolific lyricist and records her own music.<br><br>Rosamund's heart pounded as fast as the hooves of the horse beneath her. This wasn't her sweet little palfrey, her Snowdrop&#x2014;the little mare had been sent away by her stepmother without a reason, leaving only powerful, dangerous-looking black beasts in the stables.<br><br>This was one of those black horses, strong and fast, and terrifying to ride. From the moment she snatched the reins from the groom, threw herself into his saddle and smacked his rump with a riding crop, she had known she was taking her life in her hands. This was like being astride a tempest, or riding a boat over a waterfall. Her arms were a mass of scratches, and every second was an eternity of terror as she clung with all her might to his back.<br><br>But not half as terrifying as the Royal Huntsman, who was probably on another one of these monsters, chasing her down. With dogs. A pack of vicious, huge black boarhounds that had come with the Huntsman when he'd arrived weeks ago. She knew about the dogs, for sure; she could hear them baying behind her as the horse raced through the woods.<br><br>She had to crouch low over the horse's neck, because the horrible thing wasn't paying any attention to low branches; she had been whipped twice across the face before she took this position, and it was a wonder she hadn't been blinded.<br><br>Not that still having her eyesight made any difference right now.<br><br>The horse was careering through the woods, and she couldn't tell if it was on a path or not. It didn't seem to care. And even if she had known where to go, she doubted it would have responded to the reins. This was almost suicide; the beast could stumble and fall at any moment, taking her with it, killing them both, or at least breaking bones.<br><br>But behind her was certain death.<br><br>It was that terror, the glitter of the knife in the dark passageway, the bruised arm where the Huntsman had seized her, the look of cold, bored evil in the Huntsman's eyes, that had driven her to wrench herself free, to run headlong to the stables, to seize the reins of the horse waiting for her stepmother's afternoon ride&#x2014;<br><br>That terror was still coiled inside her, making her urge the horse onward.<br><br>She didn't know where the horse was going, but she had no clear idea where she should go in the first place, so that hardly mattered. She'd figure that out when she was safe from the Huntsman. She'd gotten away&#x2014;so The Tradition might be moving in her favor now. She'd find rescue. Maybe a Prince or a brave woodsman or a bold peasant boy. Maybe a princely thief with a good heart. Maybe a Wise Beast. <em>Something </em>would come to help her, surely, surely.<br><br>It must. This was Eltaria. She would <em>not </em>think about all the stories where the Evil Stepmother won, where the princess was eaten or ravished and left for dead or&#x2014;<br><br>The horse galloped onward, deeper and deeper into the woods, into the sort of forest she had never seen before.<br><br>Something <em>shrieked </em>off to the side, and the horse bucked and shied violently, as if it thought <em>she </em>was something that had leapt on its back and was about to tear its throat out.<br><br>She couldn't hold on. Red-hot pain lanced through her fingertips as her nails broke and tore off when the rim of the saddle was ripped out of her hands, and then she was flying through the air. There was a moment of clarity, and a strange calm&#x2014;then she landed in a patch of brush that broke her fall. The horse went careering off without her. And now she heard the hounds again.<br><br>But they were following the scent of the horse, not her. And the horse had tossed her a good many feet away.<br><br>She burrowed her way into the bushes rather than running senselessly after the horse, which she had no hope of catching anyway. She managed to claw her way out of sight through the mass of twigs and leaves and into the musty gloom beneath the branches, then wiggled under the bushes like a rabbit in a warren, belly-down on the dirt and leaves until she was, she hoped, well away from where she had broken her way in, and still farther from where she'd parted company with the horse. And then, with her nose inches from the ground, she waited.<br><br>The hounds bellowed past in full cry, and she shivered, hearing the sound of hoofbeats on their heels. But they didn't stop, and the Huntsman must not have seen the signs of her being thrown. They raced off, farther into the woods, on the trail of the horse. She waited, sweat cooling and itching, insects crawling over her, until the sound of baying was nothing more than a muffled moan in the distance.<br><br>Then she struggled her way to the edge of the brush patch, staggered to her feet and listened, hard, to get a direction.<br><br>She had no idea where she was, of course. So any direction was a good one, as long as it took her away from the Huntsman.<br><br>She picked her way through the dense undergrowth as best she could, trying to get as much distance as possible between herself and her pursuers. She was tired, frightened, hurting from a thousand cuts and bruises. She had no idea where she was, no food or water, no shelter. And now, yes, she <em>did </em>hear the rumble of thunder above the trees. It certainly was going to rain.<br><br>Any minute.<br><br>Could things possibly get any worse?<br><br><em>Don't think that! </em>she told herself sharply, thinking of bears&#x2014;wolves&#x2014;not-so-princely thieves. This wasn't a bad thing. The rain would wash away her scent. The hounds and the Huntsman would not be able to find her. She just needed to find someplace to get out of the rain.<br><br>And pray that The Tradition didn't want to make a Fair Corpse out of her&#x2014;<br><br>She couldn't help it. She started to cry. It shouldn't be this hard; didn't everyone in the family study what The Tradition was going to do? Shouldn't they have been able to stop this? She stumbled against an old oak tree, put out her hand to steady herself and found it was hollow. Like a frightened rabbit, she crawled inside.<br><br>It wasn't fair. It just wasn't fair. Why did her mother die? She had been so <em>good; </em>she'd never done anything to deserve to die!<br><br>But of course, the part of her mind that was always calculating, always thinking, the part she could never make just stop, said <em>and if it hadn't been that, it would have been something else. You just turned sixteen. You know what that means in The Tradition.</em><br><br>Oh, she knew. Sixteen was bad enough for ordinary girls. For the noble, the wealthy, The Tradition ruthlessly decreed what sort of birthday you would have&#x2014;if you were pretty, it was the celebration of a lifetime. If you were plain, everyone, literally <em>everyone, </em>would forget it was even your birthday, and you would spend the day miserable and alone. Traditional Paths went from there, decreeing, unless you fought it, just what the rest of your life would be like based on that birthday. For a Princess, it was worse. For the only child who was also a Princess, worse still. Curses or blessings, which might be curses in disguise, descended. Parents died or fell deathly ill. You were taken by a dragon. Evil Knights demanded your hand. Evil Sorcerers kidnapped you to marry you&#x2014;or worse.<br><br>It wasn't fair. And it didn't help that she knew exactly what to blame.<br><br>She cried and shivered and hiccupped and cried more, sneezed and shivered and cried. She wanted her father, but her father was back at the border with his army, having delivered his new Queen ceremoniously to the palace. She wanted her mother, but her mother was in the Royal Cenotaph, and Queen Sable was&#x2014;<br><br>Was an Evil Stepmother, was what she was. She had <em>nothing </em>in her wardrobe but black! Oh, she <em>said </em>it was out of respect for the late Queen Celeste, but this was Eltaria, and someone who wore nothing but black was either a poet or an Evil Sorceress, and Rosa hadn't heard Sable declaiming any sonnets or seen her scribbling in velvet-covered journals.<br><br>And besides, not three hours after the King had left again, Rosa had gone spying on the new Queen, and had seen her actually <em>talking </em>to some disembodied green head in a mirror! So that pretty much clinched the Sorceress part! And who else but an <em>Evil </em>Sorceress would have been talking to a disembodied green head?<br><br>That had been enough for her, she'd avoided her stepmother completely after that, and lived in dread of what was coming. She avoided needles, the spindles of spinning wheels, anything sharp and pointed. She kept away from balconies and only ate what she'd seen everyone else eat. She'd locked her door at night, set traps to trip up anyone coming through the window or down the chimney and had so many charms against demons and the like hung up in the canopy of her bed that they rattled softly against one another in the darkness. She'd done everything she could think of&#x2014;<br><br>But she truly had not thought that a servant, no matter how sinister, would dare to raise his hand against her.<br><br>She was so cold...so cold she ached with it and jumped every time lightning struck near, which was horribly often. And every time she thought she couldn't cry anymore, a fresh shock sent her off again.<br><br>Why had her father done this? She didn't know; at times it was as if he was two different people. There was the wonderful Father who sometimes turned up without warning to teach her how to make her nightmares stop, who gave her rare, enchanted toys, like the tiny kitten that never became a cat and would go curl up on a shelf when you told it "time for bed." Then there was the King, who was always away at war, and who treated her with the grave formality of a complete stranger.<br><br><em>Of course he did, </em>said that voice in her head. <em>If you were the beloved Princess, The Tradition would make your life, your fate, even more horrible.</em><br><br>Where was Godmother Lily then? She'd come to the funeral, but why hadn't she healed Rosa's mother? Why hadn't she kept her father from marrying that witch?<br><br>She could remember her old nurse saying something, though. <em>It doesn't always take a spell to turn a man's head and wits.</em><br><br>Just as Rosa thought that, she felt movement at her back.<br><br>And what had been, she thought, the solid wood behind her abruptly vanished.<br><br>She squeaked, frightened, confused&#x2014;had lightning knocked a hole in the tree? Had it been so rotten it was now falling to pieces?<br><br>But then she felt <em>hands!</em><br><br>They were grabbing her, seizing her, hauling at her clothing, her hair, her arms!<br><br>She screamed, kicked, tried to squirm away, scrabbled frantically at the edge of the hollow to pull herself out and run&#x2014;no matter that it was running into the storm. That didn't matter a bit when there were dozens of <em>hands </em>trying to grab her! But these hands were strong, rough, and grabbed her with grips of iron, bruising her arms, pulling her hair. She screamed again, tried to writhe, and suddenly her head was enveloped in harsh, fetid, mildew-smelling cloth.<br><br>She screamed again, fought, hit, kicked, but was pulled backward and down. She continued to fight, trying to grab for things blindly, caught what felt like roots and had her hands torn away from them.<br><br>Then there was a tremendous blow to the back of her head, and she saw stars and for a little while, lost consciousness.<br><br>When the stars and the dazzle cleared away, she felt herself being half dragged, half carried, and when she tried to wiggle free, knew immediately she had been trussed up like game. There were ropes around her upper arms and chest, more ropes tying her ankles and wrists together; two or three people had hold of her shoulders, but her heels were dragging along a dirt surface, and every so often one of them lost his grip and let her fall. She couldn't smell anything through the mildew of the bag, but it was cold and dank, like a cave.<br><br>A long time later, or so it seemed, as she collected a whole new set of bumps and bruises, she was summarily dropped on a stone floor, and the cloth was pulled off her head.<br><br>She looked up. She was in a rough stone-walled room, with seven people in it besides herself. Two of them had lanterns. She didn't have to look up very far, her captors were all very short and the two lanterns they had were more than enough for her to see them clearly. They were very dirty little men, with long beards of various colors, beards that had bits of stone and moss and probably food in them. Their rough clothing, made of what looked like canvas and leather, was ragged and in dire need of mending. No matter their short stature; they were all heavily muscled and looked very strong.<br><br>This was, of course, because they were indeed very strong, stronger than most human men. She knew what they were, of course. They were Dwarves.<br><br>Dwarves did a great deal of the mining here in El-taria. They had an uncanny feeling for rock and earth, where the best stuff was, and how to get it out without killing themselves or anyone else.<br><br>She had seen Dwarves before, quite a few of them in fact. When they got mining concessions, it was on the basis of sharing the wealth they extracted with the Crown as well as a tithe to their Clan, and the quarterly presentations of the Crown share were actually considered a sight not to be missed. The Dwarves would turn up in amazing outfits, entire gowns made of plates of metal scarcely larger than a head of a pin for their women, chain mail that looked like knitted silk for the men, and jewelry that never failed to make jaws drop for both sexes. Beards and hair were combed, braided, perfumed and bejeweled. They were truly gorgeous.<br><br>Not this lot. They were filthier than any living being Rosa had ever seen. They hadn't so much as a copper chain around their necks, nor a garnet earring. And they stank. She doubted that their beards had ever seen a brush.<br><br>There were, of course, renegade Dwarves; there were bad Dwarves just as there were bad humans, or virtually any other race. There were Dwarves who didn't want to hand over a share of what they found to the Crown or tithe to their Clan, and dug their hidden mines furtively. <br><br></p><h2>Double Cross: The Explosive, Inside Story of the Mobster Who Controlled America</h2><p>This <i>New York Times</i> bestseller presents Sam Giancana talented businessman, Las Vegas entrepreneur, ruthless killer, and outside player for the CIA&#x2019;s dirtiest deeds.

He lives on Long Island, New York.The cottage industry of Kennedy assassination theorists shows no sign of abating, as shown by this story of the much publicized revelations of Chuck Giancana, brother to Chicago Mafia Don Sam Giancana. Jerry Orbach&#39;s tough, full-voiced reading works perfectly to narrate the rise of a two-bit hood to someone who could push the button on J.F.K. and Marilyn Monroe. The story&#39;s denouement is unconvincing, but the tapes are entertaining throughout. The latter part of the story seems to rush by, perhaps indicating the lack of support for Giancana&#39;s claims.

Although in postWW II years Sicily was granted greater autonomy and the 2000-year political hold of big landowners was broken, improvements in agriculture and industry have been thwarted largely, the authors surmise, because of a political-patronage system and a resurgence of the Mafia, which the judiciary has been unable to uproot.

Roger Stern has written some of comics' greatest characters in some of their biggest moments. He wrote the epic <i>Avengers Under Siege</i> story where the Masters of Evil assaulted Avengers mansion. In his <i>Captain America</i> run, he pitted the Sentinel of Liberty against the vampiric Baron Blood for a thrilling and powerful story. He was also one of the writers who helped kill comics' greatest icon in 'The Death of Superman' storyline. [In 2005, Stern returned] to write another big moment for the Man of Steel, his first original novel in many years, "Superman: The Never-Ending Battle," a 384-page novel in Pocket Books&nbsp; Justice League series." -- <i>Dave Richards, Comic Book Resources</i>"Roger Stern has taken his years of [writing experience] and used that skill to show the human side of these heroes. I've been reading stories of these characters--Superman, Batman, The Martian Manhunter, Wonder Woman, The Flash, and Green Lantern--as far back as I can remember, but never before do I recall seeing such humanity from them. I don't mean [just] a great caring for the human race, we know they have that, but Roger Stern has made them people." -- <i>C. Dennis Moore</i><br><br>"Superman is written very well and we get to see the human element of him as much as, if not more than, the super-hero aspect. As such there are wonderful exchanges between Kal-El and his human parents, as well as with Lois and Bruce Wayne. This really added a depth to the book and raised the story to beyond the regular fare of good versus evil." -- <i>BookMarc</i><br><br>"This story, somehow, makes you feel POSITIVE as you read it, like some of Superman's&nbsp;inherent goodness is permeating your body. Also, Stern doesn't forget to&nbsp;treat the League like they're people. It's the little things that make this novel work. Superman's vast cast do superbly as well. Lois is, of course, always entertaining when written well. At the Daily Planet, the only thing missing was Perry telling Jimmy to not call him Chief. Bibbo's public challenge ... is an absolute hoot." -- <i>Aaron Thall&nbsp;</i><br><br>"The best attribute in Roger Stern's work is his heart. His stories tend to be rooted in the decency of heroes -- his heroes have HEART, as it were." -- <i>Brian Cronin</i></p><h2>Shoes Outside the Door: Desire, Devotion and Excess at San Francisco Zen Center</h2><p>Provides a close-up look at the scandals that rocked the San Francisco Zen Center, a leader in alternative religious practice and the counterculture in America, and their repercussions. 75,000 first printing.</p><p>Why did the richest, most influential, highest flying Zen center in America crash and burn in 1983? Novelist Michael Downing wondered the same thing, and after three years of interviewing members and poring over documents, his <i>Shoes Outside the Door</i> tells the story. Womanizing, BMW-driving Richard Baker was the abbot and visionary behind the rapid growth of the San Francisco Zen Center, but in many ways he was the antithesis of his teacher and predecessor, the inimitable and revered Shunryu Suzuki, who would choose the bruised apples out of compassion. After the early death of Suzuki, a blind and driven cult formed around Baker, seemingly filling the void until this "Dick Nixon of Zen" finally slept with his best friend's wife and brought his world crashing to the ground. Working with direct quotations from students and workers of the Center and its many enterprises, Downing delivers a page-turning exposï¿½ of a community that is as laudable as it is laughable. And as an outsider to both the community and Buddhism, he does it with wit and an even hand. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Michael Downing teaches creative writing at Tufts University.</p><h2>The Grumpling</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY.</p><p><b>Stephen Cosgrove</b> is one of the best-selling children&#x2019;s book authors of all time.

Salim loses control of his store to the commercially inexperienced Citizen Theotime, who hires Salim to manage it. Gradually, the town&#39;s veneer of civilization begins to crumble.</p><p>First published in 1979, A Bend in the River is a profound and richly observed novel of the politics and society of postcolonial Africa. Salim, a young Indian man, moves to a town on a bend in the river of a recently independent nation. As Salim strives to establish his business, he comes to be closely involved with the fluid and dangerous politics of the newly created state, the remnants of the old regime clashing inevitably with the new.

Tabini-aiji, powerful ruler of the Western Association, along with his son and heir, and his human <i>paidhi</i>, Bren Cameron, have returned to their seat of power. The usurper, Murini, has escaped to the lands of his supporters, but the danger these rebels pose is far from over. Ilisidi, Tabini's grandmother, the aiji-dowager, has returned to her ancient castle in the East, for though she supports the rule of her grandson, she also has powerful ties in the lands of the rebels, and she seeks to muster whatever support she can from among those enemy strongholds.<br><br>In his father's heavily armed and tightly guarded headquarters, eight-year-old Cajeiri is horribly bored. Two years on an interstellar starship surrounded by human children have left him craving excitement and the company of his peers. But unbeknownst to this dissatisfied youngster he has become a target for forces bent on destroying his father's rule and everything it stands for. Though still a child, Cajeiri embodies a unique threat to the venerable, tradition-defined lifestyle of his people. For this innocent young boy is the first <i>ateva</i> youth to have lived in a human environment, surrounded by human children. And after hundreds of years of fragile, tenuous <i>atevi</i>-human coexistance, Cajeiri may very well be the first <i>ateva</i> to ever truly understand the so similar yet so dangerously different aliens who share his home planet and threaten the hidebound customs of his race.</p><p><b>C.

She can be found at cherryh.com.At the start of the stirring ninth entry in Cherryh's much praised Foreigner series (after 2006's <i>Pretender</i>), the atevi ruler Tabini has thwarted an attempt to overthrow him, though the usurper, Murini, has not yet been captured. Things appear to have settled back into routine, except for the hijinks of Cajeiri, Tabini's young heir, who has grown used to the liberties allowed a human child but not the heir to atevi rule. Then Cajeiri disappears and a troublesome Eastern lord is suspected of kidnapping him. Murini may also be involved. Human translator and diplomat Bren Cameron, along with the elderly but indomitable atevi matriarch Ilisidi and their deadly servants from the Assassins' Guild, must set off cross country in the dead of winter to attempt a rescue, while Cajeiri must prove that he is indeed worthy to be Tabini's heir. As always, Cherryh alternates complex political maneuvering with pell-mell action sequences in an intensely character-driven SF novel sure to appeal to the many fans of this series. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The phenomenon of quilt-as-art is a tradition that has lasted throughout the years as a combination of folk art-and-crafts and personal expression. However, the quilts in this book are a far cry from grandma's retro-simplistic Double Wedding Ring. With such post-modern titles as Einstein and Tomatoes, We're Never Really Alone, Psycho Moms Bake a Cake and What Next?, these masterpieces are strong, both visually and conceptually, and break new ground. Whether abstract, representational or expressionistic, each quilt speaks to a modern audience and references today's culture like yellow checkered taxi cabs, street dancing and Volkswagen Bugs. My favorite? Tea Will Make It Better, winner of the Quilts Japan Prize, and a delightful, playful look at cross-cultural tea ceremonies. It is hard to believe that these quilts are simply bed covers made of fabric and some down, cross-stitched in between. Their irresistible beauty stands out and I am sure that the vivid, animated colors that are so well reprinted in the book are nothing compared to the real thing. -- <i>From Independent Publisher</i>Every once in a while you have to see a quilt made out of clothespins, roofing nails, and fishing line just to stretch your thinking about the possibilities of the medium.

Front matter (the first 25 pages) covers equipment, safety tips, basic skills and terms, and measurements. Seventy-six recipes follow, logically arranged to begin with breakfast and continue through dessert. The step-by-step directions are clearly laid out, and most of the dishes look delicious. The fresh and attractive design includes a mix of simple paintings (for the food) and photos (for the people). Emeril himself is shown throughout, conveying his enthusiasm and sense of play and offering a familiar note for media-savvy cooks. Nutritional information is not included, which may be a good thing, since many of the recipes are sinfully caloric (the hot chocolate recipe calls for whole milk and heavy cream and chocolate chips). For this reason, many of the dishes will be better suited for special occasions than for everyday enjoyment.<i>&#x2013;Lauralyn Persson, Wilmette Public Library, IL</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This place lives up to its name with 573 prominences of one kind or another. But the topography is in some ways the least of the adventure. With fifty-five different ecological communities packed into just twenty-odd square miles, the island is a veritable Garden of Eden. From marine eelgrass meadow to shrub swamp, low salt marsh to brackish intertidal mudflats, blueberry bog thicket to oak-tulip forest, this spot is a living embodiment of the phrase &#x201c;wealth of nature.&#x201d; There are more than twenty ponds and over sixty miles of streams and perhaps as many as three hundred springs gurgling away. There are oysters galore. There are black bears, wolves, mountain lions, whales, and porpoises. There are red-winged blackbirds, American redstarts, red-bellied woodpeckers, clapper rails, and great horned owls. There are, in the sedge department alone, densetuft, oval-leaf, hop, broadleaf, parasol, threeway, Muhlenberg&#x2019;s, Schweinitz&#x2019;s, Pennsylvania, and hairy umbrella-sedge. This is Mannahatta: a place we are all four hundred years too late to visit.1<br> <br>As it turned out, this landmass on the Atlantic Coast of North America did not become a nature preserve. It emerged instead as an urban giant: the Borough of Manhattan&#x2014;the heart of one of the most drastically transformed natural environments in the world. New York is the most populous city in the United States and has been for the last two centuries. In 1609, less than 1 percent of the Manhattan landscape showed evidence of human influence. By the early twenty-first century, 97 percent of the land had been converted to buildings, sidewalks, parking lots, streets, recreational areas, and other artifacts of civilization. The dominant species by this time was, of course, neither the oyster nor the mountain lion but Homo sapiens sapiens. Today a stunning 69,464 people per square mile live in Manhattan. And as goes Manhattan, so goes the rest of the New York metropolitan area.2<br> <br>This book is about the struggle between New York and the natural world. At its core, the story is about how, over centuries, people have come to understand, define, and ultimately transform New York&#x2019;s land, water, and its plant and animal life. The metropolitan area assumed its current shape by way of a set of contingent decisions. Which is precisely why we want to study its history: to understand how ecological change has made New York what it is today, while acknowledging that, present concerns aside, the past has a logic all its own. The struggle at the center of this story has been overwhelmingly one-sided; a man-bites-dog story, if you will. To cite just one measure, between 1900 and 2010, development had whittled down Staten Island&#x2019;s monumental 5,099 acres of marsh&#x2014;wildlands more than a third the size of all Manhattan, filled with night herons, belted kingfishers, dragonflies, and snails&#x2014;to a fractional existence the size of a mere city park (865 acres).3 Part of the story, too, is that sometimes the dog bit back.<br> <br>To examine New York is to confront what has always been&#x2014;in one form or another&#x2014;a high-density place. The key to appreciating this point is to first understand that New York exists in the estuary of the Hudson River, where freshwater meets the Atlantic Ocean. Estuaries are very special environments and, from an ecological perspective, highly productive ones. They are located at the point where freshwater and salt water join together, and play a role not only as habitat for birds and other wildlife but also in the health of oceans, by filtering water and acting as nursery grounds for fish. They tend to be crammed with life. Estuaries trap nutrients from the adjoining watershed and thus are capable of supplying food to enormous populations of species, from oysters to grasses to waterfowl. Not for nothing is the New York area one of the great stopping points for birds migrating along the Atlantic Flyway, the avian world&#x2019;s version of an interstate.4<br> <br>The ecological history of New York, then, can be summed up very simply: an estuary with a high natural density was replaced by one with an astonishingly high unnatural (for lack of a better word) density. Human beings overshadow the area, but that has hardly led to the end of nature, as it were. In fact, just the reverse. Though the diversity of the plant and animal world is less encyclopedic than what it was back when Henry Hudson made his famed voyage in 1609, some species&#x2014;gulls, Phragmites (common reed), various kinds of plankton&#x2014;have thrived on the disruption caused by squeezing more than 6 percent of the entire population of the nation into one small space. Those who see the swarms of people at Times Square and think New York is an exceptionally dense environment don&#x2019;t know the half of it.5<br> <br>ï¿½&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp;ï¿½<br> <br>There has been a sense that New York&#x2019;s success as a city was somehow foreordained, that the place was geographically destined for greatness. It is an old idea. Isaac Newton Phelps Stokes, the author of an epic early-twentieth-century study of Manhattan and its topography, wrote that commerce was &#x201c;naturally attracted&#x201d; to the &#x201c;splendid harbor.&#x201d; More recently, Harvard economist Edward Glaeser has offered a more sophisticated analysis. Acknowledging that Gotham&#x2019;s rise was a multidimensional process, he nevertheless pinpointed the ramifying economic impact of the city&#x2019;s status as a port, which itself was based on geographic advantages such as proximity to the ocean and a location along the wide and navigable Hudson River. &#x201c;In this case,&#x201d; he writes, &#x201c;geography really was destiny, and the significance of trade and immigration to the early republic ensured that New York would dominate.&#x201d; A recent popular history echoes that conclusion: &#x201c;Geography would prove to be destiny&#x2014;more, perhaps, than in the history of any other city on earth.&#x201d;6<br> <br>There is little doubting the importance of geography. But it is wrong to view it as static. For New York has undergone profound geographic transformations, especially in the last two centuries. The harbor is hardly one that George Washington (who was inaugurated here), much less Henry Hudson, would recognize. Between the early nineteenth century and 1980, an area of marshland four times the size of the island of Manhattan was destroyed. Nearly three Manhattan Islands&#x2019; worth of open water, moreover, was filled, explaining why Upper New York Bay is now only three-quarters the size it was in 1845. Altogether, an area of tidal marsh and underwater land in the Hudson estuary amounting to almost half the size of the five boroughs has been lost to urban development. It is not too much to call New York one giant reclamation project.7<br> <br>Hence, my argument is not that geography is destiny but, in a sense, the reverse. A dense city evolved in the Hudson estuary largely because of the trust in constant population and economic growth&#x2014;New York&#x2019;s destiny as articulated by those who have run it.<br> <br>When the growth fetish began is a little hard to say, but it was almost certainly manifest by the middle of the nineteenth century. By that point, the idea that progress rested on what one historian has called &#x201c;a condition of never-ending growth&#x201d; had taken root more broadly in the nation. Eventually this fascination with expansion would come to inform the thinking of New York&#x2019;s boosters as they vied to shake off the restraining grip of the natural world and reshape relations with land and sea. And this faith in the virtues of the onward march of progress continues to weigh heavily on the minds of those who rule the city. &#x201c;Growth,&#x201d; professor of urban planning Tom Angotti put it recently, &#x201c;is always presumed to be good, even in a Manhattan that is already densely packed with buildings and has little breathing room.&#x201d; That said, I am not unsympathetic to the importance of economic advancement. What inspires me instead is the necessity to accurately depict the consequences of growth for the region&#x2019;s ecological fabric.8<br> <br>ï¿½&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp;ï¿½<br> <br>Historians of New York have tended to see natural forces as a backdrop to what they consider the more important matters of politics and economics. Even the most comprehensive historical works seem to view the natural environment as little more than a preface to the tale of New York&#x2019;s rise from trading post to metropolis to megalopolis. And yet, crusades to control nature are as central to New York&#x2019;s history as battles are to the Civil War. Driving the Grand Central Parkway near La Guardia Airport, you might never know that you are passing by Meadow Lake, a man-made body of water that was once a prodigious salt marsh carved up by rivers and sporting panicled expanses of green cordgrass. That was before a war was waged to fend off the sea and make way for the appropriately named lake&#x2014;New York City&#x2019;s largest. The reinvention of a marsh as a lake gives us an inkling of the task this book takes up. We must examine how the landscape changed, who was responsible for those changes, and what environmental and social impacts grew out of them. The population density of the New York metropolitan area, after all, rests on a set of ecological imperatives such as the need for water and a place to discharge all the waste produced when millions of people live side by side. What happens in Vegas may stay there, but the same does not hold true for New York.9<br> <br>Gotham Unbound forgoes the tidy political watersheds that have defined the study of this great city and emphasizes a new set of turning points. Not simply the shift from Dutch to English rule, but the market in underwater land is what concerns me in Part 1. This was a development that not only betrayed the colonists&#x2019; approach to the natural world but also set the stage for the far more massive efforts to reshape the region and profit off the land that came later.<br> <br>Part 2 places considerable emphasis on the 1811 grid plan, which was indeed a major change that built on the earlier underwater history of Manhattan Island while laying the groundwork for the high-density living that would come to define the region. Altogether, the grid, the development of an off-island water supply, and other trends associated with the quest for limitless growth combined to cause the most radical alteration of the waters of New York Harbor in recorded history.<br> <br>What the transformation of the harbor was to the nineteenth century, the makeover of wetlands was to the hundred years that followed. Once marshlands dominated the waterfront from Long Island on the east to the Hackensack Meadowlands on the west&#x2014;little more than wind blowing across these sweeping expanses of grass. Probing the fate of the marshlands in the shadow of one of the densest urban agglomerations in the world is the subject of Part 3.<br> <br>Then the fourth and final part explores the period since 1960 as the environmental movement began to blossom. It focuses on the limits to growth in a metropolis long defined by rampant development and ends with Hurricane Sandy. In sum, Gotham Unbound tells the story of New York over the last four centuries from the ground up, a vantage point that reveals a world of change and dislocation that is otherwise difficult to discern.<br> <br>I freely admit that it is a little hard to define exactly where this book takes place. My main concern is with New York Harbor, broadly construed, and the land surrounding it. Starting with Manhattan and using the coordinates found on a compass, this means that I will examine the expanse stretching from as far east as Jones Beach on Long Island, as far west as the Meadowlands, and as far south as the edge of the New York Bight&#x2014;the shallow water extending seaward from where the coasts of New York and New Jersey meet to the edge of the continental shelf. To sum up in a word or two this far-reaching tidal network of marshes, rivers, and bays&#x2014;the habitats mainly dealt with below&#x2014;is a tall order. I simply call it Greater New York.10<br> <br>Rather than offer a comprehensive portrait of all that has happened across this vast terra infirma, I aim instead to simply make New York a less familiar proposition&#x2014;to show that there is much still to know and understand about a place that many think they know so well. Put somewhat differently, without the changes described in this study, Fresh Kills today would be a wetland and not a mountain chain. Without them, people might be fishing the pond in lower Manhattan or donning waders to walk along the aptly named Water Street. Flushing Meadows would be a meadow instead of the city&#x2019;s largest lake, Coney Island a real island, and the Meadowlands a place people think of for its snapping turtles and the whistling call of osprey, not for its football or harness racing.<br> <br>ï¿½&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp;ï¿½<br> <br>It might be tempting to write off New York Harbor&#x2019;s ecological history as a simple tale of decline and fall. But that would be inaccurate. There is no question that, by the 1920s, the harbor had reached a nadir in terms of the oxygen saturation necessary to sustain marine life and that, later on, Staten Island&#x2019;s Fresh Kills was buried under several colossal mountains of garbage. But the waters have since recovered to a great extent, and Fresh Kills, now no longer a landfill, is being turned into a city park. By the 1970s, herons and egrets had returned to the gritty Arthur Kill separating Staten Island and New Jersey, one of the most industrialized areas of the entire harbor. Today seal-watching cruises depart from Rockaway, Queens.11<br> <br>So I am not contending that the Big Apple has the biggest ecological problems in the world.12 My focus instead is on relationships: on the link between new ways of understanding land, especially underwater land, and the changing geography of the city; on the transcendence of the local water supply and the decline in marine life; on the rise of a vision of New York as an infinite proposition and the quest to encroach on the sea; on the relationship between the overproduction of waste and the making of urban mountains; and of course on the link between the present shape of the metropolitan area and the past. An ecological history of New York can help us see that it is wrong to take the city for granted but right to question how the landscape we see driving along the Belt Parkway or strolling along the Hudson River came to be.<br> <br>These connections are important to recognize because it seems fair to say, as at least one writer has, that today comparatively few New Yorkers realize that they are living in the estuary of the Hudson River.13 This lack of knowledge is perhaps understandable in a place known to many as a concrete jungle. Why would contemporary New Yorkers think of themselves as residents in an environment where river and ocean meet when so much of that environment&#x2014;its smooth cordgrass, fiddler crabs, marsh hens&#x2014;has been overshadowed by monumental building exploits? And yet there is nothing natural or inevitable about the lapse. Underst...</p><h2>Lexicon of Freemasonry</h2><p>Barnes and Noble Publishing: 1st Edition, 1st Printing.

Born Nadezhda Lokhvitskaya in 1872, she came to be admired by an impressive range of people &#x2013; from Tsar Nicholas II to Lenin &#x2013; and her popularity was such that sweets and perfume were named after her. She visited Tolstoy when she was 13 to haggle with him about the ending of <i>War and Peace</i> and Rasputin tried (and utterly failed) to seduce her. After the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 she was exiled and lived out her days in the lively Russian ï¿½migrï¿½ community of Paris, where she continued writing &#x2013; and enjoying comparable fame &#x2013; until her death in 1952. </p><p>Teffi's best stories effortlessly shift from light humour and satire to pathos and even tragedy &#x2013; ever more so when depicting the daunting hardships she and her fellow ï¿½migrï¿½s suffered in exile. While best known for her stories and feuilletons, she also moved over to other genres, from serious poetry to theatrical miniatures and even music, and inhabited an extraordinary range of spheres connected to both high and popular culture.</p><p>In the first biography of her in any language, Edythe Haber here brings Teffi &#x2013; who has recently been 'rediscovered' in the West to resounding acclaim &#x2013; to life. Teffi's life and works afford a unique panoramic view of the cultural world of early twentieth century Russia, from the debauchery of the Silver Age to the terror and euphoria of revolution, and of interwar Russian emigration. But they also offer fresh insights into the seismic events &#x2013; from the 1905 Russian Revolution and World War II to life as a refugee &#x2013; that she experienced first-hand and recreated in her vivid, penetrating, moving and witty writing.</p></p><p><b>Edythe Haber</b> is Professor Emerita at the University of Massachusetts Boston and a Center Associate at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University, USA.

He spent six years in the British Army before becoming a schoolmaster and colonial education officer in Malaya and Brunei. After the success of his Malayan Trilogy, he became a full-time writer in 1959. His books have been published all over the world, and they include The Complete Enderby, Nothing Like the Sun, Napoleon Symphony, Tremor of Intent, Earthly Powers and A Dead Man in Deptford. Anthony Burgess died in London in 1993. Andrew Biswell is the Professor of Modern Literature at Manchester Metropolitan University and the Director of the International Anthony Burgess Foundation. His publications include a biography, The Real Life of Anthony Burgess, which won the Portico Prize in 2006. He is currently editing the letters and short stories of Anthony Burgess.Anthony Burgess's 1963 novel was published with a glossary of the dystopian language used by Alex, the brutal teenage narrator. The quality of Tom Hollander's performance, however, renders such help unnecessary. Hollander's vocal suggestiveness, grasp of tone, and overall emotional resonance with the novel give listeners amazing clarity (especially if, like this reviewer, they've previously read the book relying on the glossary). You listen to Alex's adventures, amazed at the clarity Hollander gives to such a verbally ambitious work. This recording also includes the last chapter of the novel (not published in the first American edition), Burgess's later introduction to the book, and, from the Caedmon archives, Burgess himself reading excerpts.

Han privately thought that if Ubbel had been in charge, the Empire would have encompassed one of the smaller skyscrapï¿½ers on Coruscant instead of half the galaxy.<br><br>&#x201c;I can take them faster than the squad can!&#x201d; Han shouted.<br><br>&#x201c;Negative, negative, Onyx Nine, return to formation!&#x201d;<br><br>Han actually liked Onyx 2, his friend Cadet Lyttan Dree. The number of other cadets who liked him was frankly diminishï¿½ing. His natural charm always drew them in...but then most people would quickly figure out that being close to him would probably reduce their chances for advancement. Dree, or Onyx 2, managed to be a good pilot, Han&#x2019;s friend, and still folï¿½low the rules. Han had always meant to ask him how he did that, and now he might never get the chance.<br><br>Han peeled off from the formation and chased the Headhuntï¿½ers down, feeling much freer now that he could fly where he wanted to and not worry about the others in formation. In theï¿½ory he could understand the need for a formation, but in pracï¿½tice he always preferred to worry only about himself and his own ship.<br><br>He accelerated, watching the raiders flank Onyx 2 as he tried to outmaneuver them. Han&#x2019;s helmet squawked again, and he turned down the audio as Onyx Leader was shouting at him to return to formation. Then his droid started fussing at him.<br><br>Imperial droids were the worst. The White Worms hadn&#x2019;t had much use for droids, so Han hadn&#x2019;t grown up with them behind doors, underfoot, and always politely, infuriatingly, tellï¿½ing him how wrong he was.<br><br>His ship&#x2019;s intelligence, MGK-300, was such a droid. It thought that since it was integrated directly into his ship, it knew more about the ship than he did.<br><br>He&#x2019;d already long since had enough of MGK&#x2019;s so-called guidance, but it still beeped furiously at him that they were making the squadron weaker because of his actions.<br><br>Han ignored it. If the droid wasn&#x2019;t telling him something was wrong with the ship, he didn&#x2019;t see a need to listen to it.<br><br>He got one of the raiders in his sights and fired, nearly missï¿½ing, but clipping a wing. The ships separated, one keeping up with Onyx 2 and one turning to pursue Han.<br><br>Now he saw the point of the squadron formation. Han wheeled and turned, heading back, and met head-on his own fellow caï¿½dets flying toward them. He ducked to slide under them and they fired. He cheered them on, but then felt the ship heave under him as something behind him exploded.<br><br>His Infiltrator went into a spin. Han fought for control, tryï¿½ing to tune out the squeals and beeps coming from behind his head.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I know we lost the reverse thrusters! Thank you!&#x201d; The ship started to spin, the universe whirling madly around him, the Star Destroyer&#x2019;s docking bay a rapidly moving target.<br><br>MGK beeped what Han knew was standard emergency proï¿½tocol at this point&#x2014;which was essentially giving up. He shook his head. &#x201c;Not ejecting! I can make it back to the docking bay!&#x201d;<br><br>The droid made known its firm disagreement, beeping and booping faster and faster as it began to panic.<br><br>These machines were distracting, irritating, and useless. How did anyone fly with this nagging going on? &#x201c;You know what?&#x201d; he asked, flipping an emergency switch to power down the droid. MGK couldn&#x2019;t distract him now, and he could finally focus.<br><br>As if the droid were trying to get the last word in, the control panel sparked and spit when he touched the switches. Pain flared in his hand and he yelped, shaking it. Had MGK done it on purpose? He couldn&#x2019;t tell. It was pointless to wonder, beï¿½cause the docking bay was suddenly much, much closer.<br>He struggled to maintain control and decelerate. At the last possible moment, he yanked the control yoke upward, managing to slip through the artificial atmosphere of the docking bay cleanly, without clipping any of the sides&#x2014;which Han thought was pretty impressive. His ship hit the floor and bounced, caï¿½reening him into three tethered TIE fighters. His chin hit the control panel and he saw more stars, wondering briefly if he had flown straight through the ship and back into space. Then he heard the alarms and remembered where he was.<br> No one was impressed with the fact that he&#x2019;d saved Onyx 2.<br> &nbsp;<br>---<br> &nbsp;<br><br>Commodore Almudin&#x2019;s round face seemed to eclipse the rest of the tribunal. Other high-ranking important types were there, but Han could only see the ridiculous round face, even as he struggled to take the man seriously. The commodore outranked him (actually, everyone on the tribunal outranked him), and rumor had it that he&#x2019;d had an amazing flight record in his day. But right now he flew a desk and had the exciting job of senï¿½tencing real pilots in military tribunals.<br><br>Han&#x2019;s chin still throbbed from the quick work the medical droid had made of his gash, and he ignored the other aches from the crash as he stood straight.<br><br>But the officer&#x2019;s face really was irritating.<br><br>The other officers on the tribunal, two women and a man, looked both bored and annoyed, as if in their minds Han was already sentenced to death and they were just waiting for lunch.<br><br>&#x201c;Cadet Solo,&#x201d; the commodore said, like he had before, with that tone of less than disgust, &#x201c;I still can&#x2019;t decide if you&#x2019;re brave or stupid.&#x201d;<br><br>He shrugged. &#x201c;I like to think I&#x2019;m a little of both, sir.&#x201d; He paused. He could never get the ranks right. Was this man a moff? He&#x2019;d better cover all of his options. &#x201c;I mean, Moff.&#x201d; The man&#x2019;s face didn&#x2019;t change. &#x201c;Sir Moff.&#x201d;<br><br>That finally broke him. He scowled at Han and said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s &#x2018;Commodore,&#x2019; and if you think having a smart-ass attitude is the way to go here, you&#x2019;re sorely mistaken.<br><br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you tell us what allegedly happened here?&#x201d; he continued, indicating a screen that had lit up. It was flanked by two Imperial guards, Lieutenants Tag Greenley and Bink Otauna. Once upon a time, Han had attempted to befriend them, but they turned out to be such colossal screwups, Han started to avoid them before they got him or themselves killed. Still, he needed all the friends he could get. He gave them a little wave and a grin. They looked back at him wryly and said nothing.<br><br>The screen lit up and Han saw his own ship, leaving formaï¿½tion to pursue. He felt a surge of pride as he always did, seeing from the outside how free he looked. He realized he was just admiring himself, and he cleared his throat and pointed in the general direction of where Onyx 2 was being pursued.<br><br>&#x201c;Onyx Two was flanked by Headhunters.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d reported all of this. He had no idea why they needed his comments again since he&#x2019;d already given them all the information in his report. &#x201c;If I&#x2019;d followed Command&#x2019;s directive and returned to formaï¿½tion instead of going after &#x2019;em, he&#x2019;d be dead now.&#x201d;<br><br>This tribunal was ridiculous. Couldn&#x2019;t they see that he&#x2019;d saved their second in command?<br><br>&#x201c;There is no place for maverick heroics in his Emperor&#x2019;s navy.&#x201d;<br><br>Han held his hands up, as if fending off praise. &#x201c;Trust me, I&#x2019;ve got no interest in being a hero, Commodore, what I&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>The commodore cut him off abruptly. &#x201c;Well, congratulations. You&#x2019;re not one. This tribunal, me in particular, finds you guilty of disobeying a direct order, and you are hereby reassigned to the infantry. Report for immediate transfer to Mimban.&#x201d;<br><br>He wasn&#x2019;t getting kicked out. Relief flooded him. He smiled. &#x201c;Okay. I thought it was gonna be way worse.&#x201d; He cocked his head and inquired, &#x201c;And roughly, when do you think I&#x2019;ll be flyï¿½ing again?&#x201d;<br>Commodore Almudin smiled, and there was nothing friendly about it. &#x201c;Oh, we&#x2019;ll have you flying in no time.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Asperkid&#39;s Launch Pad: Home Design to Empower Everyday Superheroes</h2><p><p>For Asperkids, home is both their protected lair and their launch pad into success in a neurotypical world.

She is usually referred to as D. E. Stevenson and during her lifetime she wrote over 40 novels, which were published on both sides of the Atlantic. She married Captain James Reid Peploe in 1916 and had four children. Her first book <i>Peter West</i> was published in 1923 but she did not really start to become a novelist until 1932 with the publication of her first 'Mrs. Tim' book. Dorothy Emily Stevenson died the 30th of December 1973 at the age of 81 and was buried in Moffat, Dumfriesshire, Scotland where she lived for many years.&#x201c;The writer's unflagging humour, her shrewd, worldly wisdom, and her extremely realistic pictures of garrison life make it all good reading.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Times Literary Supplement (UK)</i></p><h2>Kung Fu: History, Philosophy, and Technique</h2><p>The book is about the history, philosophy, and techniques of Kung Fu--as the title says. Illustrated.</p><p></p><h2>Where God Happens: Discovering Christ in One Another</h2><p>The place "where God happens," according to Rowan Williams's striking new reading of the Desert Fathers and Mothers, is <i>between each other </i>. It's a truth that we of the twenty-first century most urgently need to learn in order to heal the experience of alienation that has become endemic to our age, and these odd and appealing ancient figures, surprisingly, hold keys to this healing. The fourth-century Christian hermits of Egypt, Syria, and Palestine understood the truth of Christian community profoundly, and their lives demonstrate it vividly&#x2014;even though they often lived in solitude and isolation. The author breaks through our preconceived ideas of the Desert Fathers to reveal them in a new light: as true and worthy role models&#x2014;even for us in our modern lives&#x2014;who have much to teach us about dealing with the anxieties, uncertainties, and sense of isolation that have become hallmarks of modern life. They especially embody valuable insights about community, about how to live together in an intimate and meaningful way. Williams makes these radical figures, who clearly have a special place in his heart, come to life in a new way for everyone. The book includes an appendix of selections from the teachings of the Desert Fathers.</p><p>Rowan Williams, the 104th Archbishop of Canterbury, is an acclaimed theologian, writer, and pastor, in addition to being the spiritual leader of the world&#39;s 100 million Anglicans. He was a lecturer at Cambridge University and held the Lady Margaret Chair of Divinity at Oxford University. He has been Canon Theologian of Leicester Cathedral, Bishop of Monmouth in the Church of Wales, and Archbishop of Wales. He is the author of several books, including The Dwelling of Light and A Ray of Darkness."Rowan Williams is a scholar and priest, a mystic and a poet, a contemplative and an advocate for social justice&#x2014;all rare combinations for a church leader.&nbsp; In <i>Where God Happens </i>, he combines his roles by examining the ancient wisdom of the Desert Fathers and interpreting the relevance of their teaching for Christian spirituality today.&nbsp;In the early monastics' search for the experience of God and an alternative style of community, he finds a new and deeper faith for the postmodern world.&nbsp;This compelling work of scholarship and spirituality shows why the Archbishop of Canterbury is truly a breath of fresh air and one of the most important and hopeful church leaders we have today."&#x2014;Jim Wallis, editor of <i>Sojourners</i> magazine, author of <i>God's Politics </i> "Rowan Williams calls for a Church renewed in contemplation. In the raucous circus of contemporary culture and religion nothing could be more important.&nbsp; And this book is immensely practical&#x2014;nailing us just where we are&#x2014;teaching us that the spiritual life is 'not only about how prayer is to be experienced but about how humanity is to be understood.' There's a liberating sanity here in the simplicity of the message: 'our life is with our neighbor,' and 'being is communion.' This is required reading for spiritual pilgrims of all traditions."&#x2014;Alan Jones, Dean of Grace Cathedral, San Francisco, author of <i>Soul Making </i> and <i>Reimagining Christianity </i> "This book is a marvelous introduction to the first Christian monks, the Desert Fathers, and makes their wisdom available and relevant for the twenty-first century reader; but it does more, since it is written in the same spirit as the texts from the desert, that is, as a clear window that will give direct access to God."&#x2014;Benedicta Ward, translator of <i>Sayings of the Desert Fathers </i> and <i>The Wisdom of the Desert Fathers </i></p><h2>The Magic of Watercolour</h2><p>This is an introduction to the medium of watercolour. The author reviews the roots of the English watercolour tradition and takes a practical look at materials, subject choice, how to paint landscape, weather conditions, buildings (with advice on perspective) and different methods and techniques for composing paintings and using colour.

Yet many Americans remained largely indifferent as he turned his dangerous ambitions abroad. Not William Bailey.<br>Just days after violent anti-Semitic riots had broken out in Berlin, the SS <i>Bremen</i>, the flagship of Hitler's commercial armada, was welcomed into New York Harbor. Bailey led a small group that slipped past security and cut down the Nazi flag from the boat in the middle of a lavish party. A brawl ensued, followed by a media circus and a trial, in which Bailey and his team were stunningly acquitted. The political victory ultimately exposed Hitler's narcissism and violent aggression for all of America to see.<br><i>The Agitator</i> is the captivating story of Bailey's courage and vision in the Bremen incident, the pinnacle of a life spent battling against fascism. Bailey's story is full of drama and heart--and it's an inspiration to anyone who seeks to resist tyranny.</p><p><b>Peter Duffy</b> is an author and journalist based in New York City.

He is one of Ireland's best known journalists. He is the author of <b>The South</b>, winner of the Irish Times/Aer Lingus Prize. In 1995, he was awarded the Academy of Arts and Letters E. M. Forster Prize. He is also the author of <b>The Heather Blazing</b> and <b>The Story of the Night</b>.A married Irishwoman leaves her family and finds fulfillment with a painter in Spain: no fireworks in this muted first novel from Irish journalist Toibin, though he does avoid rebirth-in-the- sun clich&#x201a;s. The year is 1950. What causes 32-year-old Katherine Proctor to bolt from husband Tom, son Richard, and their southern Irish farm is Tom's dragging their poor neighbors into court when they infringe on his land; it's her land too, and Tom's arrogance gives the deathblow to a loveless marriage. In London, Katherine gets encouragement from her mother (who had left her husband during the Troubles of 1920) and moves on to Barcelona (where her mother's checks will sustain her). Through the common interest of painting, she soon meets Michael Graves, a working-class man from her hometown who will become a supportive friend, and Miguel, who will become her lover. Miguel sells enough paintings for the two to move to the Pyrenees, to a village that feels like ``the quiet top of the world.'' An anarchist fighter against Franco, Miguel had retreated here during the Civil War; slowly Katherine realizes that neither their ``ravenous'' love nor the birth of a daughter, Isona, will heal the wounds of a war that for Miguel still continues. Ominously, he starts to see Katherine as the class enemy; after police harassment and the death of his ``leader,'' Carlos Puig, he goes to pieces, killing Isona and himself. The book's final third skims the years rapidly, as Katherine returns to Ireland, makes peace with her grown son Richard and his wife (Tom has died), and devotes herself to her painting. Toibin's spare prose (not mannered or fake Hemingway) and partial glimpses into Katherine's consciousness and background (Protestant gentry) work well enough at first, but as the years pile up, so do the questions; eventually, Toibin's withholding technique looks like a simple inability to deliver. Still, a promising debut. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

First Atheneum Books Paperback Edition; Atheneum Series No. 266. Manufactured in the USA by Fairfield Graphics, Fairfield, PA.</p><p>James Beard's 1964 classic, <i>Delights and Prejudices</i>, has been reprinted in a newly illustrated edition. This is wonderful news for all who love food and food writing. Erudite yet intimate, <i>Delights and Prejudices</i> is, first, the memoir-with-recipes of a great American gastronome. It's also fascinatingly panoramic on good meals taken worldwide; on ingredients as diverse as the potato and the truffle; on great food places, markets to restaurants; and on food people, from Beard's cantankerous, food-muse mother to many of the stars of the last century's food firmament, including Julia Child. This is not only Beard's greatest work but also one of the best books we have on food and what we know about it. <p> Beard's gastronomic life began in bounteous early-20th century Portland, Oregon, where his mother cooked for several hotels. An early culinary memory has the near-infant Beard relishing an onion, skin and all. From there the story captures a world of gastronomic likes and dislikes from "sensational" veal roasts to the gherkins known as cornichons, "one of the mistakes the French make in eating." Beard's love of French food is, however, usually unmitigated, matched only by his adoration of traditional, locally produced American cooking. Recipes for this fare, including clam soufflï¿½ and candied-ginger pumpkin pie, are among the 150 formulas offered, a Beardian crï¿½me de la crï¿½me that also encompasses hors d'oeuvres, breads, and cakes. The book also chronicles Beard's ascent to fame, beginning with his 1940s appearance on <i>I Love to Eat</i>, TV's first cooking show, to the arrival of his many influential cookbooks. It ends, characteristically, in his kitchen, "the place where [he] can best satisfy the eccentricities of [his] own palate." The journey makes am enthralling read. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p><b>James Beard</b> had a national reputation as an authority on every phase of food. Consultant to a wine and spirits establishment, he wrote seventy-six other books and numerous articles for national magazines on widely varied phases of cooking. Mr. Beard, who knew the cooking of every corner of our country, cooked in nearly every language. He lived abroad, traveled throughout Europe a number of times, saw most of the Western Hemisphere, and visited Hawaii and North Africa. His familiarity with exotic foreign foods spiced his extensive knowledge of American cooking at its best.<p>Mr. Beard was adviser to several large food companies, was food editor of Argosy magazine, and made many appearances on radio and television. His first three books are <i>Hors d'Oeuvres and Canapes, Cook It Outdoors,</i> and <i>Fowl and Game Cookery.</i> Equally at home in the kitchen of his own New York apartment and that of a hotel, James Beard brought the same sure touch to a half-hour supper as he did to the most elaborate buffet.

The music and energy of the period was fueled by the music and juices of the Beatles, Jefferson Airplane, the Rolling Stones, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors, Buffalo Springfield, the Velvet Underground, Big Brother and the Holding Company (read Janis Joplin), the Byrds, Donovan. . . and on and on. </p><p> The book covers the era both in the United States and England, where the first hint of the psychedelic era -- the marriage of drug use and pop culture -- took place on June 11, 1965, at the "Poets of the World/Poets of Our Time" reading at the Royal Albert Hall (one of the organizers of that event was Miles). The featured poets were Ginsberg, Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Gregory Corso. Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky did not read, but sat in the audience along with Indira Gandhi, the future prime minister of India. Controversial psychiatrist R.D. Laing brought along a dozen of his patients to dance and blow bubbles. </p><p> If that was the beginning of the four-year summer of love, Woodstock's protest celebration in 1969 was the culmination. </p><p> The book covers the era through text, illustration, photos, a time-line across the bottom of many of the pages and the wonderful recollections of the people who were involved. The photographs capture posters, clothing and paraphernalia from the era in addition to the musicians, artists, poets and celebrities of the time. There are memories from Grace Slick, Boz Scaggs, Bob Weir, Country Joe McDonald, Donovan, Ginsberg and many more. A double-page spread features a pschedelic-colored Buick painted by artist David Vaughan for the design group Binder, and Country Joe, Joplin and Santana are captured in action at Woodstock. </p><p> From the time-lines the reader learns that on January 24, 1967, San Francisco police chief Thomas Cahill coined the term "the Love Generation" to describe the folks living in Haight-Ashbury, and on the 27th of the same month, the United States, the Soviet Union and 58 other nations signed a treaty banning nuclear weapons in outer space. </p><p> If you can't make it to the exhibit, or the traveling show at the Mall of America from July 4 to 6, this catalog is the next best. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p></p><h2>Star Wars: The New Jedi Order: Traitor (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order, 13)</h2><p>After the capture of Coruscant, the mighty heart of the New Republic, a stunned galaxy fears that nothing can stop the Yuuzhan Vong.

Since he and his phantom guests are rather pale and diaphanous, they take on the tint of what they are eating and drinking. For example, pumpkin soup turns everyone various shades of tan and orange, salmon makes them pink, and cheese turns them yellow with holes. The secret dessert causes them to disappear altogether, and they reappear by drinking milk. The full-and double-page watercolor-and-ink illustrations appear against black backgrounds.

It is one of the longest-lived of verse forms, and one of the briefest. A mere fourteen lines, fashioned by intricate rhymes, it is, as Dante Gabriel Rossetti called it, "a moment's monument." From the Renaissance to the present, the sonnet has given poets a superb vehicle for private contemplation, introspection, and the expression of passionate feelings and thoughts. <br></p><p><br></p><p><br><br><i>The Art of the Sonnet</i> collects one hundred exemplary sonnets of the English language (and a few sonnets in translation), representing highlights in the history of the sonnet, accompanied by short commentaries on each of the poems. The commentaries by Stephen Burt and David Mikics offer new perspectives and insights, and, taken together, demonstrate the enduring as well as changing nature of the sonnet. The authors serve as guides to some of the most-celebrated sonnets in English as well as less-well-known gems by nineteenth- and twentieth-century poets. Also included is a general introductory essay, in which the authors examine the sonnet form and its long and fascinating history, from its origin in medieval Sicily to its English appropriation in the sixteenth century to sonnet writing today in the United States, the United Kingdom, and other English-speaking parts of the world.<br></p></p><p>Stephen Burt is Professor of English at Harvard.Starred Review. The sonnet may well be the poetic form that most often comes to mind when anyone thinks of poetry. Fourteen lines long, in open and closed structures, sonnets have been prominent over the past 400 years of poetic history. In this unusual book&#x2014;half anthology, half collection of essays&#x2014;Burt and Mikics, both prolific critics of poetry (Burt is also a poet himself) choose 100 sonnets and for each offer a thoughtful, scholarly, though highly accessible commentary. The oldest poem is Thomas Wyatt's Whoso List to Hunt (1557), and the newest is by the contemporary poet D.A. Powell, first published last year. In between, there's everything from Shakespeare and Wordsworth to Robert Lowell and Lucie Brock-Broido. Of Redemption, George Herbert's sonnet about the Resurrection of Christ, Mikics writes, Herbert's Savior... shocks us into attention. Of one of Ted Berrigan's sonnets, Burt says, The disorientation, the wildness, is part of the point: no more organized poem would do. While this anthology would make a wonderful textbook for a prosody class, its best audience may be anyone who wants to delve deeply into the heart of poetry.

He invites five authors to perfect his plan. Each author, narrated by a different actor, responds and then critiques the others. Victor Garber&#39;s Tim has a condescending tone which one must endure. But Josef Sommer uses a clear and highly listenable voice for Westlake&#39;s letter. George S. Irving has good vocal quality and execution (employing a diabolical laugh and second voice) for Lovesay&#39;s response. John Randolph Jones employs a Texas accent to outline Hillerman&#39;s murder.

A unique format and entertaining listen for those who enjoy mysteries. M.S. (c)AudioFile, Portland, MaineAn amplified reprint from Harper's magazine in which editor/author Hitt, as the wealthy, unhappily married ``Tim,'' puckishly asked five mystery writers--Lawrence Block, Sarah Caudwell, Tony Hillerman, Peter Lovesey, and Donald Westlake--to suggest a fabulous, money-no-object, dramatic means of disposing of his philandering ``wife'' that would incriminate his cuckolding ``best friend.'' Surprisingly, Hitt turns out to be the best writer in the group, Westlake the flattest, and Hillerman and Lovesey the funniest. Their schemes? Lovesey resurrects his jellyfish-in-the- Jacuzzi scenario, which has appeared in at least three previous anthologies; Caudwell costumes hers in Scottish kilt and plaid; Block disguises his as a serial slaying (``Kill the bitch,'' he says, over and over); Hillerman opts for a confessional twist, a dunk in the tub, and poisoned mushrooms as well; and Westlake creates a double identity so that the murderer can be his own alibi. Then Hitt asks the authors to critique each other's schemes. They gleefully attack him and each other. A hilarious means of introducing readers to the mind-set of the hard-boiled, the cozy, the traditional, the antic, and the glib state of the current mystery masterminds, with Hillerman and Lovesey the standouts. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

But even in this quiet , peaceful place, Nell never feels entirely at ease. Careful to conceal her true identity, she takes a job as a cook at the local bookstore cafe--and begins to explore her feelings for the island sheriff, Zack Todd. But there is a part of herself she can never reveal to him--for she must continue to guard her secrets if she wants to keep the past at bay. One careless word, one misplaced confidence, and the new life she&#39;s so carefully created could shatter completely. Just as Nell starts to wonder if she&#39;ll ever be able to break free of her fear, she realizes that the island suffers under a terrible curse--one that can only be broken by the descendants of the Three Sisters, the witches who settled the island back in 1692. And now, with the help of two other strong, gifted women, and the nightmares of the past haunting her every step, she must find the power to save her home, her love, and herself.</p><p></p><h2>The Hero: Manhood and Power (Art and Imagination)</h2><p>In an age of equal rights and radical feminism, the intrinsically male figure of the hero - the protector, the saviour, the man of invincible might - has lost its identity and stature. The most famous names in the history and mythology of all races are those of heroes - Herakles and Samson, who fought with the lions; Lohengrin and Perseus, who rescued princesses; the Horatii, who saved Rome; the Samurai, warriors of Japan; Gagarin, conqueror of space; Zapata, defender of his people. Rightly used, the cult of the hero has led to the highest that a culture can conceive. Misused, it has led to tyranny, violence and death. This book brings the values of epic and myth to bear upon the problems of modern man, his search for identity and the justification for his masculine role. With the &#34;masculine backlash&#34; in evidence and male consciousness-raising a topic of our time, this book proposes that the hero is poised to re-enter the world of the 1990s.</p><p>Blend comparative mythology and art and you have a fine survey of manhood, power, and its depiction in art over the centuries in The Hero.

He lives in Coral Gables, Florida.Humorist Barry (Big Trouble) brings together a motley group of South Florida eccentrics on an ill-fated casino boat voyage in his second full-length comic mystery novel. A tropical storm is bearing down on the Florida coast, but the Extravaganza of the Seas, a luxury gambling ship, sets sail on its nightly excursion in spite of the weather. Aboard are Fay Benton, an attractive cocktail waitress trying to make ends meet for her kid; a collection of pot-smoking would-be rockers (at least one of whom lives with his mother) who make up the ship's band, Johnny and the Contusions; a pair of wise-cracking octogenarians who've escaped an extended-care facility; and some Mafia-connected gangsters who use the ship's nightly voyages to smuggle drugs onto the mainland. Bobby Kemp, the ship's titular owner, insists that the Extravaganza go out in the storm because he's chosen this night to hijack the drug deal. In the background, a local television station plays a role straight from Keystone Kops as its reporters frantically cover the approaching storm with consistently fatal results. Barry once again showcases his gently satiric style, with barbs aimed at overbearing mothers, corrupt officials, inept authorities and, of course, the American crime novel itself, which he sends up with absurd plotting, astronomical body count and plenty of gratuitous nudity and (PG-rated) sex. Belying self-deprecating disclaimers about his talent for fiction, Barry demonstrates that he can draw some captivating characters and keep a reader's attention in spite of-or perhaps because of-slapstick antics and a fascination with scatology.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>In Search of the Wild Dulcimer</h2><p>Rear cover notes: &#34;Up until now, there has been no one book that explains everything about getting a good dulcimer, learning to play it, and adapting its simple sounds to more complex, contemporary styles.

In a period of almost continuous upheaval, society was transformed by two world wars, the Russian Revolution, the Holocaust, and the rise and fall of the Third Reich. Combining a powerful narrative with profound analysis, acclaimed historian Robert Gellately argues that these tragedies are inextricably linked and that to consider them as discrete events is to misunderstand their genesis and character. Central to the catastrophe, of course, were Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler, and this book makes use of recently opened Russian and German sources to explain how these dictators&#x2019; pursuit of utopian&#x2014;and dreadfully flawed&#x2014;ideals led only to dystopian nightmare. <br><br>In a groundbreaking work, Gellately makes clear that most comparative studies of the Soviet and Nazi dictatorships are undermined by neglecting the key importance of Lenin in the unfolding drama. Rejecting the myth of the &#x201c;good&#x201d; Lenin, the book provides a convincing social-historical account of all three dictatorships and carefully documents their similarities and differences. It traces the escalation of conflicts between Communism and Nazism, and particularly of the role of Hitler&#x2019;s anathema against what he called &#x201c;Jewish Bolshevism.&#x201d; The book shows how the vicious rivalry between Stalin and Hitler led inescapably to a war of annihilation and genocide. The reverberations of this gargantuan struggle are felt everywhere to this day.</p><p>Robert Gellately is the Earl Ray Beck Professor of History at Florida State University and was the Bertelsmann Visiting Professor of Twentieth-Century Jewish Politics and History at Oxford University in 2004&#x2013;05.

Initially, in August 1914, the nation rallied around the flag. Politicians and the urban middle classes welcomed the war, and the army went off to defend their &#x201c;Slavic brothers&#x201d; in Yugoslavia against German and Austrian aggression. The Duma, Russia&#x2019;s national assembly, dissolved itself to symbolize the country&#x2019;s support of the government. But no one in Europe, let alone in Russia, visualized the war to come, the devastation it would cause, and how long hostilities would last.<br><br>The tsarist empire had the largest army in Europe but lacked the resources to fight a prolonged struggle. Before the first year of the fighting was over, there were shortages of all kinds. Replacement troops were being trained without rifles and sent onto the battlefield, where they were to go among the dead and wounded to pick up the weapons they needed.<br><br>By the beginning of 1917, widespread discontent over the ghastly sacrifices of the war, food shortages, and high prices led to bitter strikes and hostile demonstrations. A police report for January 1917 from Petrograd, the newly renamed capital, spelled out the darkening situation: &#x201c;These mothers, exhausted from standing endlessly in lines and having suffered so much watching their half-starving and sick children, are perhaps much closer to a revolution than Messrs. Miliukov, Rodichev, and Co. [leaders of the liberal Kadet Party], and of course much more dangerous.&#x201d;[1]<br><br>The pent-up resentments and grievances were ignited by a demonstration in the capital on February 23, when a peaceful march for women&#x2019;s rights was joined by striking workers. Cries rang out for bread, and people exclaimed, &#x201c;Down with the tsar!&#x201d; By February 26, under orders from the tsar, troops fired on demonstrators. Some of the soldiers were sickened by what they did, and then the next day the revolution began as mutinous troops rampaged through the streets killing or disarming police. Crowds shouting &#x201c;Give us bread,&#x201d; &#x201c;Down with the war,&#x201d; &#x201c;Down with the Romanovs,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Down with the government&#x201d; attacked police headquarters.<br><br>Instead of charging the crowds, tens of thousands of peasant soldiers, their mentality shaped by decades of grievances against the system, went over to the people. Together they exploded in a mixture of rage and revenge that rumbled on for days. The police put machine guns atop buildings, but even these were ineffective against the angry tumult.[2]<br><br>Tsar Nicholas II was informed, and on March 2, in a meeting at the front, Aleksandr Guchkov and Vasily Shulgin, deputies of the State Duma, laid out the stark options. Guchkov pronounced the home front and military out of control. The situation was not &#x201c;the result of some conspiracy,&#x201d; but represented &#x201c;a movement that sprang from the very ground and instantly took on an anarchical cast and left the authorities fading into the background.&#x201d;<br><br>The upheaval had spread to the army, &#x201c;for there isn&#x2019;t a single military unit that isn&#x2019;t immediately infected by the atmosphere of the movement.&#x201d; Guchkov believed that it might be possible to prevent the inevitable if a radical step was taken. He explained:<br><br>"The people profoundly believe that the situation was caused by the mistakes of those in authority, in particular the highest authority, and this is why some sort of act is needed that would work upon the popular consciousness. The only path is to transfer the burden of supreme rulership to other hands. Russia can be saved, the monarchical principle can be saved, the dynasty can be saved. If you, Your Majesty, announce that you are transferring your power to your little son, if you assign the regency to Grand Duke Mikhail Alexandrovich, and if in your name or in the name of the regent instructions are issued for a new government to be formed, then perhaps Russia will be saved. I say perhaps because events are unfolding so quickly."[3]<br><br>Dismayed at this turn of events, Nicholas II accepted the inevitable, and on March 3, 1917, he abdicated, also in the name of his gravely ill son. The tsar stepped down in favor of his brother Grand Duke Mikhail, who tried to get assurances of support in the capital. He asked leading figures from the Duma, including Prince Georgii Lvov, Mikhail Rodzianko, and Alexander Kerensky, whether they could vouch for his safety if he accepted the crown. None thought they could, so Mikhail was left with little choice but to refuse the crown.[4] In fact a third of the members of the State Duma formed a &#x201c;provisional committee&#x201d; on the afternoon of February 27, and by March 2, with the tsar&#x2019;s abdication, that became the new provisional government.[5]<br><br>The American ambassador in Petrograd witnessed what he regarded as &#x201c;the most amazing revolution.&#x201d; He reported that a nation of 200 million living under an absolute monarchy for a thousand years had forced out their emperor with a minimal amount of violence. The three-hundred-year rule of the Romanov dynasty was over.[6] In fact the revolution was not &#x201c;bloodless,&#x201d; for in Petrograd alone estimates of the new government put the killed or wounded at 1,443. Even the higher figures mentioned were small in comparison with what was to follow.[7]<br><i>LENIN AND THE BOLSHEVIKS</i><br><br>The main Marxist party, the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP), including the Bolshevik and Menshevik factions, had nothing to do with this liberal revolution that swept away the Romanovs. Lenin was in Switzerland. Stalin was isolated in western Siberia, in exile since 1913. Most other top Bolshevik and Menshevik leaders were far removed from the action as well, with Leon Trotsky and Nikolai Bukharin five thousand miles away in North America.<br><br>But just over seven months after the February liberal revolution, the world learned of the October Communist revolution, headed by Lenin and the Bolsheviks. It was to change the course of world history, and the twentieth century was to be the bloodiest ever.<br><br>Lenin was born into a well-to-do family in Simbirsk. His parents named him Vladimir Ilych Ulyanov. Later, following the practice of Russian revolutionaries, he took Lenin as his pseudonym. His grandfather on his mother&#x2019;s side, Dr. Alexander Blank, was Jewish, about which a great deal was made later on, but Lenin had no memory of him at all, and there was no connection with Judaism in his life. Lenin&#x2019;s father was a higher civil servant, and the family lived in the style of provincial dignitaries. His father died from a sudden illness in early 1886.<br><br>Lenin&#x2019;s older brother Alexander was at university in St. Petersburg at the time. He was involved with one of the many revolutionary groups and identified with Russia&#x2019;s intelligentsia, who were raised on Western education and saw their own society as culturally and politically backward.<br><br>For decades the intelligentsia had striven to bring Russia up to Western standards. Each generation experimented with different revolutionary tactics. Sometimes the mood gave rise to nihilists who rejected everything, and at other times revolutionaries were inspired by the idea of going to the people to &#x201c;instruct&#x201d; them.[8]<br><br>The intelligentsia from the 1870s onward grew more radical. On March 1, 1881, one of many splinter groups assassinated Tsar Alexan-der II, in hopes of stirring up massive social and political unrest and sparking revolution. Lenin&#x2019;s brother joined another group intent on killing the successor to the throne, Alexander III. However, the ever- vigilant Okhrana, the secret police, got wind of the conspiracy. The plan had been to attack the tsar on March 1, 1887, the anniversary of the last tsar&#x2019;s death. Arrests followed, and, shockingly for his family, Lenin&#x2019;s older brother was hanged along with four others in May.<br><br>The young Lenin reacted quietly to these dramatic events. He had always been diligent in school, and he went back to his books and continued his studies. He registered as a student in the law faculty at Kazan University in the fall of 1887.<br><br>Little is known about Lenin&#x2019;s extracurricular activities in this period, but as one might expect, he had some contact with student radicals and probably participated in protests against the government. As the brother of the conspirator and would-be assassin Alexander, he likely came under particular scrutiny from the tsarist authorities. While he was certainly not the student radical that subsequent Soviet lore made him out to be, he was duly rounded up by the police for the part he allegedly played in demonstrations. He was expelled from the university in December 1887 and exiled to Kokushkino, but by mid-1890 he was allowed to begin the process of registering as an external student at St. Petersburg University, from which he was awarded a law degree in November 1891. In the meantime, he had become a voracious reader of left-wing literature.<br><br>Lenin gravitated toward the fledgling Russian Marxist movement rather than the Russian populists, who emphasized agrarian Socialism. According to Karl Marx, the Socialist revolution was to be expected in the most advanced countries when the contradictions of mature capitalism reached a crisis that could not be resolved within the prevailing economic conditions. Even for committed Russian Marxists, it was certainly debatable whether Marx&#x2019;s theories really fitted Russia, but Lenin took a doctrinaire approach and tried to &#x201c;prove&#x201d; that capitalism already existed there. He did not waver from this position and later, in 1899, published a large tome on the topic. Although it was filled with statistics and analysis of the driest kind, it surprisingly got the attention of young radicals in distant parts of the Russian Empire. Anastas I. Mikoyan, slightly younger (born 1895) than Lenin, but later t...</p><h2>The Historical Atlas of the Celtic World</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Well written, edited, and produced, this is just the book for a Celtophile to wile away the hours and the pints with.&#x201d; &#x2015;<em>Booklist</em></strong></p> Through fifty-four color maps, covering almost 3,000 years and spanning the whole of Europe, this atlas of the Celts charts their dramatic history from Bronze Age origins to present-day diaspora.

They went single file around the bend where the stone wall jutted out closer to the water&#x2019;s edge. Ahead a smaller path split off at an angle ï¿½toward the crossing place, where the flowing water spread out and became shallower, bubbling around exposed rocks.<br><br>Before they reached the fork in the trail a young woman near the front suddenly stopped, her eyes opening wide as she stood perfectly still, staring ahead. She pointed with her chin, not wanting to move. &#x201c;Look! Over there!&#x201d; she said in a hissing whisper of fear. &#x201c;Lions!&#x201d;<br><br>Joharran, the leader, lifted his arm, signaling the band to a halt. Just beyond the place where the trail diverged, they now saw ï¿½pale-ï¿½tawny cave lions moving around in the grass. The grass was such effective camouflage, however, that they might not have noticed them until they were much closer, if it ï¿½hadn&#x2019;t been for the sharp eyes of Thefona. The young woman from the Third Cave had exceptionally good vision, and though she was quite young, she was noted for her ability to see far and well. Her innate talent had been recognized early and they had begun training her when she was a small girl; she was their best lookout.<br><br>Near the back of the group, walking in front of three horses, Ayla and Jondalar looked up to see what was causing the delay. &#x201c;I wonder why we&#x2019;ve stopped,&#x201d; Jondalar said, a familiar frown of worry wrinkling his forehead.<br><br>Ayla observed the leader and the people around him closely, and instinctively moved her hand to shield the warm bundle that she carried in the soft leather blanket tied to her chest. Jonayla had recently nursed and was sleeping, but moved slightly at her mother&#x2019;s touch. Ayla had an uncanny ability to interpret meaning from body language, learned young when she lived with the Clan. She knew Joharran was alarmed and Thefona was frightened.<br><br>Ayla, too, had extraordinarily sharp vision. She could also pick up sounds above the range of normal hearing and feel the deep tones of those that were below. Her sense of smell and taste were also keen, but she had never compared herself with anyone, and ï¿½didn&#x2019;t realize how extraordinary her perceptions were. She was born with heightened acuity in all her senses, which no doubt contributed to her survival after losing her parents and everything she knew at five years. Her only training had come from herself. She had developed her natural abilities during the years she studied animals, chiefly carnivores, when she was teaching herself to hunt.<br><br>In the stillness, she discerned the faint but familiar rumblings of lions, detected their distinctive scent on a slight breeze, and noticed that several people in front of the group were gazing ahead. When she looked, she saw something move. Suddenly the cats hidden by the grass seemed to jump into clear focus. She could make out two young and three or four adult cave lions. As she started moving forward, she reached with one hand for her ï¿½spear-ï¿½thrower, fastened to a carrying loop on her belt, and with the other for a spear from the holder hanging on her back.<br><br>&#x201c;Where are you going?&#x201d; Jondalar asked.<br><br>She stopped. &#x201c;There are lions up ahead just beyond the split in the trail,&#x201d; she said under her breath.<br><br>Jondalar turned to look, and noticed movement that he interpreted as lions now that he knew what to look for. He reached for his weapons as well. &#x201c;You should stay here with Jonayla. I&#x2019;ll go.&#x201d;<br><br>Ayla glanced down at her sleeping baby, then looked up at him. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re good with the ï¿½spear-ï¿½thrower, Jondalar, but there are at least two cubs and three grown lions, probably more. If the lions think the cubs are in danger and decide to attack, you&#x2019;ll need help, someone to back you up, and you know I&#x2019;m better than anyone, except you.&#x201d;<br><br>His brow furrowed again as he paused to think, looking at her. Then he nodded. &#x201c;All right . . . but stay behind me.&#x201d; He detected movement out of the corner of his eye and glanced back. &#x201c;What about the horses?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They know lions are near. Look at them,&#x201d; Ayla said.<br><br>Jondalar looked. All three horses, including the new young filly, were staring ahead, obviously aware of the huge felines. Jondalar frowned again. &#x201c;Will they be all right? Especially little Gray?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They know to stay out of the way of those lions, but I don&#x2019;t see Wolf,&#x201d; Ayla said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d better whistle for him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to,&#x201d; Jondalar said, pointing in a different direction. &#x201c;He must sense something, too. Look at him coming.&#x201d;<br><br>Ayla turned and saw a wolf racing ï¿½toward her. The canine was a magnificent animal, larger than most, but an injury from a fight with other wolves that left him with a bent ear gave him a rakish look. She made the special signal that she used when they hunted together. He knew it meant to stay near and pay close attention to her. They ducked around people as they hurried ï¿½toward the front, trying not to cause any undo commotion, and to remain as inconspicuous as possible.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you&#x2019;re here,&#x201d; Joharran said softly when he saw his brother and Ayla with the wolf quietly appear with their ï¿½spear-ï¿½throwers in hand.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know how many there are?&#x201d; Ayla asked.<br><br>&#x201c;More than I thought,&#x201d; Thefona said, trying to seem calm and not let her fear show. &#x201c;When I first saw them, I thought there were maybe three or four, but they are moving around in the grass, and now I think there may be ten or more. It&#x2019;s a big pride.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And they are feeling confident,&#x201d; Joharran said.<br><br>&#x201c;How do you know that?&#x201d; Thefona asked.<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re ignoring us.&#x201d;<br><br>Jondalar knew his mate was very familiar with the huge felines. &#x201c;Ayla knows cave lions,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Perhaps we should ask her what she thinks.&#x201d; Joharran nodded in her direction, asking the question silently.<br><br>&#x201c;Joharran is right. They know we&#x2019;re here. And they know how many they are and how many we are,&#x201d; Ayla said, then added, &#x201c;They may see us as something like a herd of horses or aurochs and think they may be able to single out a weak one. I think they are new to this region.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What makes you think so?&#x201d; Joharran said. He was always surprised at Ayla&#x2019;s wealth of knowledge of ï¿½four-ï¿½legged hunters, but for some reason it was also at times like this that he noticed her unusual accent more.<br><br>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t know us, that&#x2019;s why they&#x2019;re so confident,&#x201d; Ayla continued. &#x201c;If they were a resident pride that lived around people and had been chased or hunted a few times, I don&#x2019;t think they would be so unconcerned.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, maybe we should give them something to be concerned about,&#x201d; Jondalar said.<br><br>Joharran&#x2019;s brow wrinkled in a way that was so much like his taller though younger brother&#x2019;s, it made Ayla want to smile, but it usually showed at a time when smiling would be inappropriate. &#x201c;Perhaps it would be wiser just to avoid them,&#x201d; the ï¿½dark-ï¿½haired leader said.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so,&#x201d; Ayla said, bowing her head and looking down. It was still difficult for her to disagree with a man in public, especially a leader. Though she knew it was perfectly acceptable among the Zelandonii&#x2014;after all, some leaders were women, including, at one time, Joharran and Jondalar&#x2019;s mother&#x2014;such behavior from a woman would not have been tolerated in the Clan, the ones who raised her.<br><br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; Joharran asked, his frown turning into a scowl.<br><br>&#x201c;Those lions are resting too close to the home of the Third Cave,&#x201d; Ayla said quietly. &#x201c;There will always be lions around, but if they are comfortable here, they might think of it as a place to return when they want to rest, and would see any people who come near as prey, especially children or elders. They could be a danger to the people who live at Two Rivers Rock, and the other nearby Caves, including the Ninth.&#x201d;<br><br>Joharran took a deep breath, then looked at his ï¿½fair-ï¿½haired brother. &#x201c;Your mate is right, and you as well, Jondalar. Perhaps now is the time to let those lions know they are not welcome to settle down so close to our homes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This would be a good time to use ï¿½spear-ï¿½throwers so we can hunt from a safer distance. Several hunters here have been practicing,&#x201d; Jondalar said. It was for just this sort of thing that he had wanted to come home and show everyone the weapon he had developed. &#x201c;We may not even have to kill one, just injure a couple to teach them to stay away.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jondalar,&#x201d; Ayla said, softly. Now she was getting ready to differ with him, or at least to make a point that he should consider. She looked down again, then raised her eyes and looked directly at him. She ï¿½wasn&#x2019;t afraid to speak her mind to him, but she wanted to be respectful. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s true that a ï¿½spear-ï¿½thrower is a very good weapon. With it, a spear can be thrown from a much greater distance than one thrown by hand, and that makes it safer. But safer is not safe. A wounded animal is unpredictable. And one with the strength and speed of a cave lion, hurt and wild with pain, could do anything. If you decide to use these weapons against those lions, they should not be used to injure, but to kill.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s right, Jondalar,&#x201d; Joharran said.<br><br>Jondalar frowned at his brother, then grinned sheepishly. &#x201c;Yes she is, but, as dangerous as they a...</p><h2>The Vatican Moscow Washington Alliance</h2><p>The Vatican plays a vital part in history and world politics, as well as Biblical prophecy.

Her 'biographies' of flight expose the dangers that escape entailed and the courage it took to risk all for freedom. Only by measuring those dangers can the exhilaration of success be comprehended and the unspeakable misery of failure be appreciated.--Ira Berlin, from the Foreword<br><br>During the American Revolution, thousands of slaves fled their masters to find freedom with the British. <i>Epic Journeys of Freedom</i> is the astounding story of these runaways and the lives they made on four continents. Having emancipated themselves, with the rhetoric about the inalienable rights of free men ringing in their ears, these men and women struggled tenaciously to make liberty a reality in their own lives.<br><br>This alternative narrative of freedom fought for and won is uniquely compelling; historian Cassandra Pybus's groundbreaking research has uncovered individual stories of runaways who left America to forge difficult new lives in far-flung corners of the British Empire. Harry, for example, one of George Washington's slaves, escaped from Mount Vernon in 1776, was evacuated to Nova Scotia in 1783, and eventually relocated to Sierra Leone in West Africa with his wife and three children. Ralph Henry, who ran away from the Virginia firebrand Patrick Henry in 1776, took a similar path to precarious freedom in Sierra Leone, while others, such as John Moseley and John Randall, were evacuated with the British forces to England. Stranded in England without skills or patronage during a period of high unemployment, they were among thousands of newly freed poor blacks who struggled just to survive. While some were relocated to Sierra Leone, others, like Moseley and Randall, found themselves transported to the distant penal colony of Botany Bay, in Australia.<br> <br><i>Epic Journeys of Freedom,</i> written in the best tradition of history from the bottom up, is a fascinating insight into the meaning of liberty; it will change forever the way we think about the American Revolution.</p><p>Cassandra Pybus holds the Australian Research Council Chair of History at the University of Tasmania. An award-winning author who has written ten books, she is a frequent Fulbright professor and international fellow at American universities.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>During the Revolutionary War, thousands of black slaves served with, and sought refuge from, the British forces in hope of attaining freedom&#x2014;among them escapees from the plantations of George Washington and Patrick Henry. Australian historian Pybus follows the path some of these former slaves took to London and then "into two bizarre colonial experiments that began in 1787: the Province of Freedom in Sierra Leone on the west coast of Africa, and the penal settlement of Botany Bay on the east coast of Australia." Readers familiar with the American perspective (the escape North, the Liberian settlement) will experience a kaleidoscopic shift through the lens of British history. Pybus's prose is weighted by her "diligent excavation in vast Revolutionary-era archival materials, both American and British." But the ships' logs, muster lists and parish records as well as the newspapers, memoirs and journals she's ploughed through in her successful attempt "to recover the lives of individuals" constitute a significant contribution to contemporary studies of the Black Atlantic. Dauntingly full of minutiae, Pybus's text is made more accessible to the ordinary reader through a biographical appendix that provides brief sketches of the "significant black refugees." <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

One of the greatest poets of the last half century, his work evokes the loss of his homeland and is suffused with the pain of dispossession and exile. His poems display a brilliant acuity, a passion for and openness to the world and, above all, a deep and abiding humanity.

The object of that quest - the great, ocean-going Chinese junk Tek Sing, which had nearly 2,000 people on board and a priceless cargo of porcelain when it was wrecked on the Belvidere Reef in 1822. The discovery of this extraordinary time-capsule focuses attention on a deeply embarrassing period of history for the British, when it government was involved in the supply of millions of pounds&#39; worth of illegal opium into China every year, in quantities that were wreaking havoc on the Chinese economy. The story of the Tek Sing draws dramatic attention to the intricacies and ironies of the opium circuit at the time. The antique porcelain that has miraculously survived the disaster is of a design and style rarely seen before in the West and its resurfacing of the history of Chinese porcelain manufacture. Not only is the porcelain intrinsically beautiful, it encapsulates and commemorates a long-forgotten fragment of the past.</p><p></p><h2>Class: A Guide Through The American Status System</h2><p>The bestselling, comprehensive, and carefully researched guide to the ins-and-outs of the American class system with a detailed look at the defining factors of each group, from customs to fashion to housing.<br><br>Based on careful research and told with grace and wit, Paul Fessell shows how everything people within American society do, say, and own reflects their social status.

And always touchy. You can outrage people today simply by mentioning social class, very much the way, sipping tea among the aspidistras a century ago, you could silence a party by adverting too openly to sex. When, recently, asked what I am writing, I have answered, "A book about social class in America," people tend first to straighten their ties and sneak a glance at their cuffs to see how far fraying has advanced there. Then, a few minutes later, they silently get up and walk away. It is not just that I am feared as a class spy. It is as if I had said, "I am working on a book urging the beating to death of baby whales using the dead bodies of baby seals." Since I have been writing this book I have experienced many times the awful truth of R. H. Tawney's perception, in his book <i>Equality</i> (1931): "The word 'class' is fraught with unpleasing associations, so that to linger upon it is apt to be interpreted as the symptom of a perverted mind and a jaundiced spirit."<br><br>Especially in America, where the idea of class is notably embarrassing. In his book <i>Inequality in an Age of Decline</i> (1980), the sociologist Paul Blumberg goes so far as to call it "America's forbidden thought." Indeed, people often blow their tops if the subject is even broached. One woman, asked by a couple of interviewers if she thought there were social classes in this country, answered: "It's the dirtiest thing I've ever heard of!" And a man, asked the same question, got so angry that he blurted out, "Social class should be exterminated!"<br><br>Actually, you reveal a great deal about your social class by the amount of annoyance or fury you feel when the subject is brought up. A tendency to get very anxious suggests that you are middle-class and nervous about slipping down a rung or two. On the other hand, upper-class people love the topic to come up: the more attention paid to the matter the better off they seem to be. Proletarians generally don't mind discussions of the subject because they know they can do little to alter their class identity. Thus the whole class matter is likely to seem like a joke to them -- the upper classes fatuous in their empty aristocratic pretentiousness, the middles loathsome in their anxious gentility. It is the middle class that is highly class-sensitive, and sometimes class-scared to death. A representative of that class left his mark on a library copy of Russell Lynes's <i>The Tastemakers</i> (1954). Next to a passage patronizing the insecure decorating taste of the middle class and satirically contrasting its artistic behavior to that of some more sophisticated classes, this offended reader scrawled, in large capitals, "BULL SHIT!" A hopelessly middle-class man (not a woman, surely?) if I ever saw one.<br><br>If you reveal your class by your outrage at the very topic, you reveal it also by the way you define the thing that's outraging you. At the bottom, people tend to believe that class is defined by the amount of money you have. In the middle, people grant that money has something to do with it, but think education and the kind of work you do almost equally important. Nearer the top, people perceive that taste, values, ideas, style, and behavior are indispensable criteria of class, regardless of money or occupation or education. One woman interviewed by Studs Terkel for <i>Division Street: America</i> (1967) clearly revealed her class as middle both by her uneasiness about the subject's being introduced and by her instinctive recourse to occupation as the essential class criterion. "We have right on this street almost every class," she said. "But I shouldn't say class," she went on, "because we don't live in a nation of classes." Then, the occupational criterion: "But we have janitors living on the street, we have doctors, we have businessmen, CPAs."<br><br>Being told that there are no social classes in the place where the interviewee lives is an old experience for sociologists. "'We don't have classes in our town' almost invariably is the first remark recorded by the investigator," reports Leonard Reissman, author of <i>Class in American Life</i> (1959). "Once that has been uttered and is out of the way, the class divisions in the town can be recorded with what seems to be an amazing degree of agreement among the good citizens of the community." The novelist John O'Hara made a whole career out of probing into this touchy subject, to which he was astonishingly sensitive. While still a boy, he was noticing that in the Pennsylvania town where he grew up, "older people do not treat others as equals."<br><br>Class distinctions in America are so complicated and subtle that foreign visitors often miss the nuances and sometimes even the existence of a class structure. So powerful is "the fable of equality," as Frances Trollope called it when she toured America in 1832, so embarrassed is the government to confront the subject -- in the thousands of measurements pouring from its bureaus, social class is not officially recognized -- that it's easy for visitors not to notice the way the class system works. A case in point is the experience of Walter Allen, the British novelist and literary critic. Before he came over here to teach at a college in the 1950s, he imagined that "class scarcely existed in America, except, perhaps, as divisions between ethnic groups or successive waves of immigrants." But living awhile in Grand Rapids opened his eyes: there he learned of the snob power of New England and the pliability of the locals to the long-wielded moral and cultural authority of old families.<br><br>Some Americans viewed with satisfaction the failure of the 1970s TV series <i>Beacon Hill,</i> a drama of high society modeled on the British <i>Upstairs, Downstairs,</i> comforting themselves with the belief that this venture came to grief because there is no class system here to sustain interest in it. But they were mistaken. <i>Beacon Hill</i> failed to engage American viewers because it focused on perhaps the least interesting place in the indigenous class structure, the quasi-aristocratic upper class. Such a dramatization might have done better if it had dealt with places where everyone recognizes interesting class collisions occur -- the place where the upper-middle class meets the middle and resists its attempted incursions upward, or where the middle class does the same to the classes just below it.<br><br>If foreigners often fall for the official propaganda of social equality, the locals tend to know what's what, even if they feel some uneasiness talking about it. When the acute black from the South asserts of an ambitious friend that "Joe can't class with the big folks," we feel in the presence of someone who's attended to actuality. Like the carpenter who says: "I hate to say there are classes, but it's just that people are more comfortable with people of like backgrounds." His grouping of people by "like backgrounds," scientifically uncertain as it may be, is nearly as good a way as any to specify what it is that distinguishes one class from another. If you feel no need to explicate your allusions or in any way explain what you mean, you are probably talking with someone in your class. And that's true whether you're discussing the Rams and the Forty-Niners, RVs, the House (i.e., Christ Church, Oxford), Mama Leone's, the Big Board, "the Vineyard," "Baja," or the Porcellian.<br><br>In this book I am going to deal with some of the visible and audible signs of social class, but I will be sticking largely with those that reflect choice. That means that I will not be considering matters of race, or, except now and then, religion or politics. Race is visible, but it is not chosen. Religion and politics, while usually chosen, don't show, except for the occasional front-yard shrine or car bumper sticker. When you look at a person you don't see "Roman Catholic" or "liberal": you see "hand-painted necktie" or "crappy polyester shirt"; you hear <i>parameters</i> or <i>in regards to.</i> In attempting to make sense of indicators like these, I have been guided by perception and feel rather than by any method that could be deemed "scientific," believing with Arthur Marwick, author of <i>Class: Image and Reality</i> (1980), that "class...is too serious a subject to leave to the social scientists."<br><br>It should be a serious subject in America especially, because here we lack a convenient system of inherited titles, ranks, and honors, and each generation has to define the hierarchies all over again. The society changes faster than any other on earth, and the American, almost uniquely, can be puzzled about where, in the society, he stands. The things that conferred class in the 1930s -- white linen golf knickers, chrome cocktail shakers, vests with white piping -- are, to put it mildly, unlikely to do so today. Belonging to a rapidly changing rather than a traditional society, Americans find Knowing Where You Stand harder than do most Europeans. And a yet more pressing matter, Making It, assumes crucial importance here. "How'm I doin'?" Mayor Koch of New York used to bellow, and most of his audience sensed that he was, appropriately, asking the representative American question.<br><br>It seems no accident that, as the British philosopher Anthony Quinton says, "The book of etiquette in its modern form...is largely an American product, the great names being Emily Post...and Amy Vanderbilt." The reason is that the United States is preeminently the venue of newcomers, with a special need to place themselves advantageously and to get on briskly. "Some newcomers," says Quinton, "are geographical, that is, immigrants; others are economic, the newly rich; others again chronological, the young." All are faced with the problem inseparable from the operations of a mass society, earning respect. The comic Rodney Dangerfield, complaining that he don't get none, belongs to the same national species as that studied by John Adams, who says, as early as 1805: "The rewards...in this life are <i>esteem</i> and <i>admiration</i> of others -- the punishments are <i>neglect</i> and <i>contempt</i>....The desire of the esteem of others is as real a want of nature as hunger -- and the neglect and contempt of the world as severe a pain as the gout or stone...." About the same time the Irish poet Thomas Moore, sensing the special predicament Americans were inviting with their egalitarian Constitution, described the citizens of Washington, D.C., as creatures<br><br>Born to be slaves, and struggling to be lords.<br><br>Thirty years later, in <i>Democracy in America,</i> Alexis de Tocqueville put his finger precisely on the special problem of class aspiration here. "Nowhere," he wrote, "do citizens appear so insignificant as in a democratic nation." Nowhere, consequently, is there more strenuous effort to achieve -- <i>earn</i> would probably not be the right word -- significance. And still later in the nineteenth century, Walt Whitman, in <i>Democratic Vistas</i> (1871), perceived that in the United States, where the form of government promotes a condition (or at least an illusion) of uniformity among the citizens, one of the unique anxieties is going to be the constant struggle for individual self-respect based upon social approval. That is, where everybody is somebody, nobody is anybody. In a recent Louis Harris poll, "respect from others" is what 76 percent of respondents said they wanted most. Addressing prospective purchasers of a coffee table, an ad writer recently spread before them this most enticing American vision: "Create a rich, warm, sensual allusion to your own good taste that will demand respect and consideration in every setting you care to imagine."<br><br>The special hazards attending the class situation in America, where movement appears so fluid and where the prizes seem available to anyone who's lucky, are disappointment, and, following close on that, envy. Because the myth conveys the impression that you can readily earn your way upward, disillusion and bitterness are particularly strong when you find yourself trapped in a class system you've been half persuaded isn't important. When in early middle life some people discover that certain limits have been placed on their capacity to ascend socially by such apparent irrelevancies as heredity, early environment, and the social class of their immediate forebears, they go into something like despair, which, if generally secret, is no less destructive.<br><br>De Tocqueville perceived the psychic dangers. "In democratic times," he granted, "enjoyments are more intense than in the ages of aristocracy, and the number of those who partake in them is vastly larger." But, he added, in egalitarian atmospheres "man's hopes and desires are oftener blasted, the soul is more stricken and perturbed, and care itself more keen."<br><br>And after blasted hopes, envy. The force of sheer class envy behind vile and even criminal behavior in this country, the result in part of disillusion over the official myth of classlessness, should never be underestimated. The person who, parking his attractive car in a large city, has returned to find his windows smashed and his radio aerial snapped off will understand what I mean. Speaking in West Virginia in 1950, Senator Joseph R. McCarthy used language that leaves little doubt about what he was really getting at -- not so much "Communism" as the envied upper-middle and upper classes. "It has not been the less fortunate or members of minority groups who have been selling this nation out," he said, "but rather those who have had all the benefits..., the finest homes, the finest college education...." Pushed far enough, class envy issues in revenge egalitarianism, which the humorist Roger Price, in <i>The Great Roob Revolution</i> (1970), distinguishes from "democracy" thus: "Democracy demands that all of its citizens begin the race even. Egalitarianism insists that they all <i>finish</i> even." Then we get the situation satirized in L. P. Hartley's novel <i>Facial Justice</i> (1960), about "the prejudice against good looks" in a future society somewhat like ours. There, inequalities of appearance are redressed by government plastic surgeons, but the scalpel isn't used to make everyone beautiful -- it's used to make everyone plain.<br><br>Despite our public embrace of political and judicial equality, in individual perception and understanding -- much of which we refrain from publicizing -- we arrange things vertically and insist on crucial differences in value. Regardless of what we say about equality, I think everyone at some point comes to feel like the Oscar Wilde who said, "The brotherhood of man is not a mere poet's dream: it is a most depressing and humiliating reality." It's as if in our heart of hearts we don't want agglomerations but distinctions. Analysis and separation we find interesting, synthesis boring.<br><br>Although it is disinclined to designate a hierarchy of social classes, the federal government seems to admit that if in law we are all equal, in virtually all other ways we are not. Thus the eighteen grades into which it divides its civil-service employees, from grade 1 at the bottom (messenger, etc.) up through 2 (mail clerk), 5 (secretary), 9 (chemist), to 14 (legal administrator), and finally 16, 17, and 18 (high-level administrators). In the construction business there's a social hierarchy of jobs, with "dirt work," or mere excavation, at the bottom; the making of sewers, roads, and tunnels in the middle; and work on buildings (the taller, the higher) at the top. Those who sell "executive desks" and related office furniture k...</p><h2>Drifters Volume 2</h2><p>Heroes from Earth&#39;s history are deposited in an enchanted land where humans subjugate the nonhuman races.

Upon his death, the painting, like much of van Gogh's work, went to his brother, Theo. A few years later, Theo's widow sold it for 300 francs (worth, then, $58). In 1990, a wealthy Japanese businessman paid $82.5 million at a Christie's auction for it and promptly hid it away in a Tokyo warehouse, where it presumably remains to this day. <p> Cynthia Saltzman traces the painting's provenance through a century of art collecting and cultural politics. Along the way, the portrait passes through--among others--the hands of early modernist collectors, the Nazi regime (where it was shown as part of an exhibit of "degenerate" art), and New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. In addition to a detailed account of the circumstances of each change of possession (it slipped out of the Nazis' hands, for example, when Herman Goerring needed a quick transfusion of hard currency), Saltzman provides a sensitive appraisal of the changing critical reputation of van Gogh and of the fluctuating market for "masterpieces" on canvas. <i>Portrait of Dr. Gachet</i> is an art history which never loses sight of the fact that art history is always a subset of a larger history.</p>A former reporter for <b>Forbes</b> and <b>The Wall Street Journal</b>, Cynthia Saltzman earned degrees in art history at Harvard and Berkeley.

Using never-before-seen documents and candid interviews with hundreds of players, associates, and corporate chieftains, the book offers an intimate portrait of Beman&#39;s shift from hardened competitor to an executive of change, who inherited a Tour that owned as its largest capital asset an IBM typewriter. Golf&#39;s Driving Force discloses how during his 20-year tenure Beman transformed a loosely-knit association of tournaments into the envy of the sports world. Discover how Beman survives a coup led by Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer, conceives the TPC network of courses, and orchestrates deals that made the Tour one of the most successful enterprises in sports.</p><p>Deane Beman has had more influence on professional golf than any man in history. Among sports commissioners, he rates ahead of Landis and Rozelle. They built it; he invented it. If you care about the game, you'll want to read this book. --Jerry Tarde, Editor-in-Chief of Golf Digest<br><br>Without Deane Beman, there wouldn t be a PGA Tour, a Players Championship, or a TPC Sawgrass as we know it. This is an inside read on how it all came together where the bodies are buried, so to speak. This isn't just Deane's memoirs; the reporting and writing of Adam Schupak make it a history lesson about a pioneer and game changer. --Tim Rosaforte, Golf World/Golf Digest, Golf Channel and NBC Sports<br><br>No one can doubt that Deane Beman was a visionary. But what is too often overlooked is how much he loves the game. Beman decided a taciturn leadership style was what best served the PGA Tour when he was transforming it into a major sports league, but the public was mostly denied the best part of the man. In Golf s Driving Force, Adam Schupak brings us the Deane Beman we missed. The result is a fascinating and diligently reported narrative that reveals important history. If you care about golf and especially if you love it read this book. --Jaime Diaz, Senior Writer at Golf Digest/Golf World</p><h2>Citizens of the Green Room: Profiles in Courage and Self-Delusion</h2><p>Author of the groundbreaking #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>This Town, </i>Mark Leibovich returns with a masterly collection of portraits of Washington&#x2019;s elite, and wannabe elites. Hailed by <i>The Washington Post </i>as a &#x201c;master of the political profile,&#x201d; Leibovich has spent his career writing memorable, buzz-worthy, and often jaw-dropping features about politicians and other notables. Currently chief national correspondent for <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>, Leibovich punctures the inflated personas of the powerful, and in <i>Citizens of the Green Room, </i>he reveals the lives, stories, and peculiarities behind the public masks.<br><br>A brilliant reporter with a talent for subversive, engaging storytelling, Leibovich maintains a refreshing conviviality with many of his subjects even as he renders incisive and unflinching assessments. His features have driven the national conversation while exposing the fallibilities of the kingmakers and media stars: consider his 2007 profile of Hillary Clinton, which unearthed a treasure trove of old letters that the then senator had written as a vulnerable young college student; or his much-talked-about 2010 portrait of Glenn Beck, which laid bare the tortured soul and precarious standing of the once invincible host and his uneasy relationship with his soon-to-be ex-employer FOX News. In the political arena, Leibovich&#x2019;s portraits &nbsp;of John Kerry, Paul Ryan, Chris Christie, and John McCain are already classics; they invariably remind us that great journalism and stylish writing are not only essential to the Republic but necessary to maintain the citizenry&#x2019;s sanity and humor in the face of made-for-TV government.</p><p>MARK LEIBOVICH is <i>The New York Times Magazine&#x2019;s</i> chief national correspondent, based in Washington, D.C. He is the #1 <i>New York Times</i>&#x2013;bestselling author of <i>This Town</i>. Leibovich lives with his family in Washington, D.C.<b>INTRODUCTION</b><p><b>Public Actors: Hillary Drank Two Glasses of Red Wine</b></p><p>Early in my ramble as a political reporter, I would come back to the office after a trip to, say, a presidential debate, or a convention, or a campaign event with candidate so-and-so. Steve Reiss, my sagacious editor at the <i>Washington Post</i>&#x2019;s Style section, would always begin his debriefing with the same question: &#x201c;What was it like?&#x201d; It struck me as a strange construction. He would not say, &#x201c;How was your trip?&#x201d; or &#x201c;What&#x2019;d you get?&#x201d; or&#x2014;in the case of an encounter with a profile subject&#x2014;&#x201c;What was he/she like?&#x201d; He always said, &#x201c;What was <i>it </i>like,&#x201d; and after a while I took the &#x201c;it&#x201d; to incorporate the whole unnatural experience that these subjects endure on their daily high wires. In halting responses, I would share with Steve little stories and impressions and off-color details about my expeditions: how, say, John Edwards walked like a duck, or that Dick Cheney had no idea who John Travolta was, or that Nancy Pelosi had never heard of curly fries.</p><p>Steve later observed that very little of what I shared with him in his office would ever wind up in my stories. Quite often there was good reason: ground rules (they were off the record), or good taste (former POW John McCain telling me a joke about prison rape), or the fact that Mike Huckabee&#x2019;s scatological humor was ill-suited to a profile pegged to his new diet and nutrition book. But a lot of the good material also evaded print for bad reasons. It didn&#x2019;t fit, in part because I was too attentive to the banal conventions of so much political reporting; I was too conscientious about including talking points, pro forma quotes from &#x201c;experts&#x201d; and the requisite &#x201c;others disagree&#x201d; paragraphs (on the one hand, on the other hand, etc.). Steve urged me to listen to the stories I was telling my friends, was telling him, and was myself chuckling at, and then to liberate them into print as often as I could.</p><p>In the course of these conversations, I came to recognize that Steve was highlighting for me a basic dichotomy between what a reporter sees and what a reporter knows. The better the reporter becomes at integrating these, the more illuminating his material becomes. Whether he meant it or not, Steve was getting me to train my eyes and ears on the things that were revelatory rather than, say, dutiful (or merely quotable). I started listening differently to the people I was talking to, both in real time and on tape. Did Chris Matthews really just say that thing about Koreans? Did Haley Barbour just pat his wife on the ass as she walked by him? Did Teresa Heinz Kerry just snap at her husband again? I came to notice how nervous, glib, or confident they sounded; and I also learned how to interact with these people in a way that best elicited more authentic expressions. Over time, and this took years, I developed better senses to go to battle with. I also learned that a key to writing about people in public life is recognizing another core dichotomy: the one between what a subject wants to project to the world (and devotes a great deal of time, energy, and manpower to) and who they truly are. Clearly for the writer, the idea is to convey as much of the latter as possible and as little of the spin and bullshit of the former. For the public actor, the relentless challenge they endure in trying to manage that gap&#x2014;what to reveal and what to withhold, what to emphasize and what to obscure&#x2014;is a wholly consuming experience. In many ways, it defines their realities. Steve would always ask me another question, too. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s different about them?&#x201d; By &#x201c;them&#x201d; he meant the public actors. They were often people of great renown and acclaim. They were recognized around town, usually Washington, DC, in those double-take instances that a public actor becomes an actual person before you. (<i>Hey, isn&#x2019;t that . . . ? It looks like Newt Gingrich. Or an overgrown kid playing Newt for Halloween? Yes, it is the real Newt&#x2014;an actual sighting, just a few seconds ago, here at the Starbucks near the United Airlines counter at Reagan National Airport. And he is standing with someone who has the same silver-haired helmet on her head as his wife Callista does. So it must be Newt!</i>)</p><p>Public actors carry themselves with a jumpy expectation that they are being studied at all times. Often they are. They have a special sense that others are squinting in their directions. Their voices assume a deeper tone as if they are always speaking into a microphone. (&#x201c;<i>It&#x2019;s good to see you again, Wolf.&#x201d;</i>) They walk faster. Their assistant will follow up with you later. They know the names of the makeup ladies and the valet guys and where the Snickers bars are kept in the green rooms.</p><p>&#x201c;The rich are different from you and me,&#x201d; F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote memorably in <i>The Great Gatsby</i>. And so are the citizens of the green room. After a while, they acquire a shiny <i>otherness</i>&#x2014;a stately gaze, a sweeping pace of movement, and sometimes comet trails of entourages. They navigate life in a perpetual &#x201c;on&#x201d; state, as naturally as a trout inhabits a stream. And they sweep into green rooms, the safe habitat where upcoming TV guests, debate participants, and various lofty haircuts get touched up, miked, and fed before their spotlight turns. Political green rooms in particular embody the unreality these paragons endure. Unlike, say, a diva&#x2019;s green room on Broadway or Van Halen&#x2019;s on tour (sans brown M&amp;M&#x2019;s), political green rooms don&#x2019;t guarantee privacy. In joint appearances or debate settings, combatants are often joined, awkwardly, in rich anthropological scenarios: like Howard Dean, John Edwards, and John Kerry jockeying in line outside a public backstage men&#x2019;s room before a Democratic presidential debate. They are suspicious rivals (Dean eyeing Kerry for allegedly cutting him in line), but they also, clearly, all belong.</p><p>Not everyone in a green room is a legal citizen of the place. It takes repeated exposure and a quiet sense developed over time. That is the vague path to citizenship in the green room, which becomes a proxy for being an accredited citizen of public life. You are seen <i>around</i>. Tip O&#x2019;Neill&#x2014;a Golden Green-Room God back in his day&#x2014;used to diminish certain past-primers by saying, &#x201c;You know, you never see him <i>around</i> anymore.&#x201d; What could be more dismissive? Are they even still alive?</p><p>Full citizenship in the green room has both advantages and killer burdens. &#x201c;There is relentless scrutiny that now stalks not only people in politics but people in all kinds of public arenas,&#x201d; Hillary Clinton said in an April 2014 speech in Portland, Oregon. &#x201c;And it gives you a sense of being kind of dehumanized.&#x201d; I was struck by her word choices, some of them jarring: &#x201c;stalked&#x201d; and, especially, &#x201c;dehumanized.&#x201d;</p><p>I think of those studies about the effect of life in prison; inmates who are brutalized or placed in solitary confinement. &#x201c;Dehumanized&#x201d; gets thrown around in those contexts, too. What is it like to be a human object in a dehumanizing machine? To be a prisoner in makeup?</p><p><i>Copyright 2014 by Mark Leibovich.

Since Vespasian is paying for it, he's charged Falco with making sure Rome's money isn't being wasted, as well as with tracking down the suspects--two jobs that morph into one as the body count keeps rising. Falco is a lively protagonist who can't stay out of trouble but always comes out of it with the mystery solved and his sense of humor intact in this consistently fine series of historical thrillers. <i>--Jane Adams</i><p>Author Residence: London, England Author Hometown: Birmingham, England</p><br>LINDSEY DAVIS has written nineteen novels, beginning with <i>The Course of Honour</i>, the love story of the Emperor Vespasian and Antonia Caenis.

Within these pages, you&#x2019; learn how all things, wanted and unwanted, are brought to you by this most powerful law of the universe, the Law of Attraction. (that which is like unto itself is drawn). You&#x2019; most likely heard the saying " attracts like," " of a feather flock together," or " is done unto you as you believe" (a belief is only a thought you keep thinking); and although the &amp;I/I&gt;has been alluded to by some of the greatest teachers in history, it has never before been explained in as clear and practical terms as in this latest book by New York Times best-selling authors, Esther and Jerry Hicks. Learn here about the omnipresent Laws that govern this Universe and how to make them work to your advantage. The understanding that you&#x2019; achieve by reading this book will take all the guesswork out of daily living. You&#x2019; finally understand everything that&#x2019; happening in your own life as well as in the lives of those you&#x2019; interacting with. This book will help you to joyously be, do, or have anything that you desire.</p><p>Excited about the clarity and practicality of the translated word from the Beings who call themselves Abraham, Esther and Jerry Hicks began disclosing their amazing Abraham experience to a handful of close business associates in 1986. Recognizing the practical results being received by themselves and by those people who were asking practical questions and then applying Abraham&#x2019;s answers to their own situations, Esther and Jerry made a deliberate decision to allow the teachings of Abraham to become available to an ever-widening circle of seekers of how to live a happier life. Using their San Antonio, Texas, conference center as their base, Jerry and Esther have traveled to approximately 50 cities a year since 1989, presenting interactive Law of Attraction workshops to those leaders who gather to participate in this expanding stream of progressive thought. And although worldwide attention has been given to this philosophy of Well-Being by Leading Edge thinkers and teachers who have, in turn, incorporated many of Abraham&#x2019;s Law of Attraction concepts into their best-selling books, scripts, lectures, and so forth, the primary spread of this material has been from person to person&#x2014;as individuals begin to discover the value of this form of spiritual practicality in their personal life experiences. In November 2011, Jerry made his transition into Non-Physical, and now Esther continues to conduct the Abraham workshops with the help of her physical friends and co-workers and, of course, with the Non-Physical help of Abraham and Jerry. People are able to access Abraham directly by attending the seminars in person or by participating in the online live streaming of most events. There is also an extensive YouTube library of Abraham videos. Abraham&#x2014;a group of uplifting Non-Physical teachers&#x2014;present their Broader Perspective through Esther Hicks. And as they speak to our level of comprehension through a series of loving, allowing, brilliant, yet comprehensively simple essays in print and in sound, they guide us to a clear connection with our loving Inner Being, and to uplifting self-empowerment from our Total Self.

His inspired use of ordinary plants and herbs has helped thousands of men and women, among them Ali Khan, King Farouk, Pope John XXIII, Cocteau, and President Herriot of France. <br><br>Messeque describes how, using only vegetables, fruits, and herbs, he cured the rheumatism in Mistinguett's million-dollar legs; made complexions smooth and fresh, eyes brilliant, smiles radiant, and hair clean, silky and healthy. Here he shares, one-by-one, what he believes to be the age-old secrets of nature. <br><br>Among Messeque's preparations are fresh cabbage leaves for bandaging wounds, lettuce for calming restlessness, watercress for clearing lungs, and fennel for normalizing an insufficient menstrual flow. He includes preparations he recommends for rheumatism, allergies, nervous complaints, sexual problems , bad circulation, and problems with the heart, kidney, bladder, liver, stomach, and intestines. <br><br>In the beauty section, the plant master recommends treatments for eczema, sunburn, bites, wrinkles, balding, oily or dry hair and skin. There are Messegue's formulas for face masks, perfumes, body lotions, eye compresses, beauty baths, mild douching mixtures, and external treatments which help reduce fat. Among Messegue's beauty recommendations are nasturtium for preventing baldness, blueberries for improving eyesight, the white sap of dandelions for making warts disappear, and garlic and apricot for restoring color to the cheeks. The natural beauty products which are sweeping the country, Messegue emphasizes, lack the most important quality in beauty treatment: Freshness. He applies the same principles to the food we eat. It is in quest of savor and soundness that we find health and beauty.</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Chicago Apartments: A Century of Lakefront Luxury (Urban Domestic Architecture Series)</h2><p>CHICAGO APARTMENTS is a unique examination of nearly100 elevator structures whose luxurious amenities, generous or unusual interior spaces, architectural features, locations or innovations have made them significant in the history of Chicago apartment life.

Ferreiro tells the full story of the Geodesic Mission to the Equator for the very first time.&nbsp;It was an age when Europe was torn between two competing conceptions of the world: the followers of Renï¿½ Descartes argued that the Earth was elongated at the poles, even as Isaac&nbsp;Newton contended that it was flattened. A nation that could accurately determine the planet&#x2019;s shape could securely navigate its oceans, giving it great military and imperial advantages.&nbsp;Recognizing this, France and Spain organized a joint expedition to colonial Peru, Spain&#x2019;s wealthiest kingdom.&nbsp;Armed with the most advanced surveying and astronomical equipment, they would measure a degree of latitude at the Equator, which when compared with other measurements would reveal the shape of the world.&nbsp;But what seemed to be a straightforward scientific exercise was almost immediately marred by a series of unforeseen catastrophes, as the voyagers found their mission threatened by treacherous terrain, a deeply suspicious populace, and their own hubris.<p>A thrilling tale of adventure, political history, and scientific discovery, <i>Measure of the Earth </i>recounts the greatest scientific expedition of the Enlightenment through the eyes of the men who completed it&#x2014;pioneers who overcame tremendous adversity to traverse the towering Andes Mountains in order to discern the Earth&#x2019;s shape. &nbsp;In the process they also opened the eyes of Europe to the richness of South America and paved the way for scientific cooperation on a global scale.</p></p><p><b>Larrie D.

Ferreiro&#x2019;s skill as storyteller and scholar is displayed in full vigor. Easy to read and fast moving, the book is often dramatic.&nbsp; ... Rarely does a history of science volume discuss such events, and rarely does its author present them so well. Ferreiro also masterfully blends political and scientific history, going to lengths to place the expedition&#x2019;s people and events in context.&#x201d;</p><b><i>Wall Street Journal </i></b>&#x201c;Deftly told....&nbsp; Mr. Ferreiro's superb book makes every mosquito bite, pork dinner and sleepless night seem worth it.&#x201d;&nbsp;<i><b>Washington</b></i><i><b> Post</b></i> &#x201c;An astonishingly detailed account of the Geodesic Mission...

In <i>Measure of the Earth</i>, Larrie Ferreiro takes us inside the scientific expedition that set off from France to South America in the 18th century to discover the answer. Ferreiro not only brings to life the band of characters that embarked on this journey, with all of their intrigues and rivalries, but he also details the huge stakes involved. Whichever county discovered the Earth&#x2019;s correct shape would take a giant leap forwards in enhancing their military and economic power.&nbsp; A fascinating account of scientific inquiry thoroughly enmeshed in the race for power and empire.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br><b>Peter C.

In 1835, upon the request of Arthur Tappan, Finney established the theology department at Oberlin Collegiate Institute (today known as Oberlin College).

They have collaborated on the hilarious Tacky the Penguin series and many other wildly funny and popular titles including the award-winning Hooway for Wodney Wat. Lynn Munsinger is a full-time illustrator who divides her time between Connecticut and Vermont.His ears are enormous, but listening is not the forte of a bunny named Buddy. And his misinterpretations of his parents's requests make for the sort of silly confusion that youngsters love: when his father asks for a pen, Buddy drags in a disgruntled hen; instead of the slice of bread his mother wants, Buddy turns up with the sawed-off headboard from a bed. Taking his first solo "long hop," Buddy forgets whether he is supposed to take a left or a right when the road forks. He selects the wrong route, of course, and ends up at the cave of the Scruffy Varmint, where he unleashes merry mayhem in trying to help that cranky creature cook soup. After the varmint decides that he'd rather eat stew made from "the Bunnyrabbit who never listens," Buddy hears him loud and clear. If lacking the all-out pizazz of Lester and Munsinger's Tacky the Penguin, this sprightly paced tale amiably nudges kids whose direction-following skills need some honing. Munsinger's watercolors-and Buddy's comical expressions in particular-are characteristically entertaining.

Voted one of the Top Ten Restaurants by <i>Esquire</i> magazine and the Best New Restaurant by <i>Boston</i> magazine, it has also been voted Favorite Restaurant in the <i>Zagat Guide to Boston and Vicinity.</i><br> <br>Todd's robust, intensely flavored food begs to be savored and shared with others. And since the complexity of English's cooking comes from the layering of tastes and textures&#x2014;not exotic equipment or techniques&#x2014;by following the careful, step-by-step instructions, even the timid cook can recreate the dishes that the patrons of English's hugely popular Boston restaurant enjoy at the Olives table.<br> <br>Pull out the stops and begin a meal with Todd's signature Olives Tart, baked in a crisp crust and rich with olives and creamy goat cheese, pair Gingered Slow-Braised Lamb Shanks with Apple-Fennel Mashed Potatoes for your main course, and finish with Falling Chocolate Cake with Raspberry Sauce. Or for a lighter repast, try Pan-Fried Cornmeal-and-Cumin-Rubbed Cornish Game Hens served with Arugula Salad with Tomato and Cucumber Juice; finish with Mango-Raspberry Granita. Plan a simple but deeply satisfying supper of Roasted Clams with Chicken, Tomatoes, Artichokes, and Bacon served with roasted new potatoes and end with Gingersnap Risotto Pudding. Whatever meal you decide to create from these recipes, you won't be disappointed.</p><p>Todd English is articulate about how he cooks. His food is uniquely Mediterranean, muscular and sophisticated; he describes it as "refined rustic." His purpose in <i>The Olives Table</i> is to show home cooks how to make simple Mediterranean ingredients "more interesting, more elaborate, more fun." These ingredients include lobster and foie gras, as well as fresh figs, artichokes, and other seasonal foods. Many dishes are elaborate show stoppers, as in Asparagus Risotto with Ragu of Crazy Mushrooms, Porcini Cream, and White Truffles, or time-consuming: Free-Form Tuscan-Style Rabbit Lasagne that you would more likely want to travel to Cambridge to enjoy. But also look for tempting, simpler dishes you can easily make, provided you have access to impeccable, fresh ingredients like tuna and local, vine-ripened tomatoes. A few highlights are Baked Potato Salad, Ginger Mustard Chicken, and My Mama's Zucchini (a kind of stew). Look, too, for Chocolate Risotto.<b>Todd English</b> is the chef-owner of Olives and the three branches of Figs, all award-winning restaurants located in Boston.

Fascinated since childhood by this strange tale of an orphan boy's recruitment into the Indian secret service, Peter Hopkirk here retraces Kim's footsteps across Kipling's India to see how much of it remains. To attempt this with a fictional hero would normally be pointless. But Kim is different. For much of this Great Game classic was inspired by actual people and places, thus blurring the line between the real and the imaginary. Less a travel book than a literary detective story, this is the intriguing story of Peter Hopkirk's quest for Kim and a host of other shadowy figures.</p><p><b>Peter Hopkirk</b> has traveled widely in the regions where his six books are set&#x2014;Central Asia, the Caucasus, China, India and Pakistan, Iran, and Eastern Turkey.

On occasion, mystery would find its way into her romances, embroiling her well-born heroes and heroines in adventures that were alternately chilling and hilarious. In <i>The Reluctant Widow</i>, Eleanor Rochdale, a young woman of good birth but straitened circumstances, sets out to accept a position as a governess and ends up plunged into a tangle of foreign intrigue instead. <p> Eleanor's adventure begins when she inadvertently mistakes the carriage waiting at the coach stop for one sent by her prospective employer, Mrs. Macclesfield. She finds herself carried to the estate of one Ned Carlyon, whom Eleanor mistakes for Mr. Macclesfield. Carlyon, meanwhile, believes Eleanor to be the young woman he hired to marry his dying cousin, Eustace Cheviot, in order to avoid inheriting Cheviot's estate himself. Somehow, Eleanor is talked into marrying Eustace on his deathbed and thus becomes a wealthy widow almost as soon as the ring is on her finger. What starts out as a simple business arrangement soon becomes much more complicated as housebreakers, uninvited guests, a shocking murder, missing government papers, and a dog named Bouncer all contribute to this lively, frequently hilarious tale of mistaken identities, foreign espionage, and unexpected love set during the Napoleonic Wars.</p>By chance, Elinor Rochdale is swept up in a thrilling adventure. Overnight the would-be governess becomes mistress of a ruined estate and partner in a conspiracy to save a family&#39;s name. By midnight she is a bride, by dawn a widow.</p><h2>Life List: A Woman&#39;s Quest for the World&#39;s Most Amazing Birds</h2><p>A frustrated housewife sets out to see more bird species than anyone in history&#x2014;and ends up risking her life again and again in the wildest places on earth. <p></p>Phoebe Snetsinger had planned to be a scientist, but, like most women who got married in the 1950s, she ended up keeping house, with four kids and a home in the suburbs by her mid-thirties. Numb and isolated, she turned to bird-watching, but she soon tired of the birds near home and yearned to travel the world. Then her life took a crushing turn: At forty-nine, she was diagnosed with cancer and told that she had less than a year to live. Devastated, she began crisscrossing the globe, finding rare and spectacular birds that brought her to the heights of spiritual ecstasy. But as it turned out, she beat the cancer. She eventually went to more than a hundred countries, had frequent brushes with danger, became a hero in the birding world, and set a record for the most species seen. <i>Life List </i>is a powerful portrait of a woman who found refuge from society&#x2019;s expectations in a dangerous and soul-stirring obsession.</p><p><p></p>Olivia Gentile earned a B.A. from Harvard College and an M.F.A. from Columbia University. She was a fellow at the MacDowell Colony in 2006. She was an award-winning newspaper reporter in Vermont and Connecticut and now lives in New York City.&#x201c;After graduating Phi Beta Kappa from Swarthmore, Snetsinger stayed home with [her] four children, a dedicated but dissatisfied mother who might have served only as a cautionary tale for feminists if, one day in 1965, she hadn&#x2019;t encountered&#x2014;in her own backyard&#x2014;a Blackburnian Warbler. Snetsinger&#x2019;s very ordinariness is part of the charm of <i>Life List,</i> Olivia Gentile&#x2019;s provocative biography of an amateur ornithologist ... That Snetsinger flew the coop was both a point of pride and a point of friction for her family, and Gentile does not cast judgment but simply describes what she sees.

After studying at Oxford and five years in the army, he took up a career as an art dealer. He wrote three Mortdecai novels (of which this is the third), a historical novel involving an ancestor of Mortdecai, and left a fifth novel unfinished at his death in 1985. Since he died, the Mortdecai novels have achieved cult status.This third installment of the scintillating British mystery series originally published in the U.K. in the 1970s finds shady art dealer Charlie Mortdecai, randy wife Johanna and butler Jock, a "one-eyed, one-fanged" ex-convict, sojourning on the isle of Jersey. The setting provides many targets&#x2014;drunken peasants, rich tourists, quaint French customs, unintelligible patois&#x2014;for Charlie's jaundiced drolleries. His omnidirectional disdain is intruded upon by a string of brutal rapes, with Satanic ritual overtones, that victimize his neighbors and embroil him in a farcical investigation featuring fruitless stakeouts and a Black Mass. Through it all, Charlie keeps his priorities straight: avoiding personal danger and inconvenience and ensuring that the flow of food and alcohol is never interrupted. Bonfiglioli's comic invention and lacerating, politically incorrect humor are in brilliant form, but they take on a somewhat rancid edge in this outing. Unlike the innocuous art thievery that figured in <i>Don't Point That Thing at Me</i>, Bonfiglioli's first volume, serial rape is the wrong background for the facetiousness and light misogyny that characterizes Charlie's satirical voice. Weighed down by this dissonance, the laughs finally falter and the story ends on a dark note of trauma and suicide. Fans of Charlie's dissolute charm and outrageous wit will find it, but some readers may decide that certain crimes just aren't funny. <i>(July 5)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Begay's subjects vary from the sublime (creation, prayer, death, healing) to the mundane (riding in a truck, splashing in the mud after rain). Coyote (Ma'ii) plays a recurrent and significant role here, but Begay's impulse is to note and celebrate, rather than explain, important aspects of his culture. There are lessons to be learned, both cultural and universal, but obliquely. He does not blame the contemporary Anglo world for anything, but it intrudes, in ways often uncomprehending or disharmonious, and must be reckoned with. He chooses, nevertheless, to end his book in a season of hope with a poem called "Early Spring." The two central themes here, beauty and mystery, find natural expression in 20 acrylic paintings. Their stippled surfaces recall pointillist or Impressionist style, but the artist's palette rests on colors rooted to his people: the vermillion of desert earth and the blues of sky, flower, and turquoise. His figures are dignified but not idealized. Powerful and appealing in both word and image, this reflective book should find a wide audience of sympathetic readers.?Patricia (Dooley) Lothrop Green, St. George's School, Newport, RI<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.With these heartfelt paintings, poems and memoirs, the noted Navajo artist fulfills his stated goal of taking the reader "into the corners of my world, the Navajo world." Similar in conception to George Littlechild's This Land Is My Land, this book places more emphasis on the traditional and spiritual, its contemporary setting notwithstanding. The sacred intertwines with the everyday; topics here range from storytelling, a solar eclipse and a healing ritual to riding in a truck and attending a tribal fair. Begay also explores the "constant struggle for balance" between his two worlds, as in "Storm Pattern," where he recalls his mother gently refusing to introduce images he saw in magazines into her rug weaving, images he now recognizes as corporate logos. Some of the paintings are dappled watercolors like those in Ma'ii and Cousin Horned Toad, others acrylics with thick, dynamic brushstrokes. Whatever the style, each reveals an indimate knowledge of a people in harmony with the land.

Chesterton's <i>Orthodoxy: The Romance of Faith</i> is, as he called it, a "slovenly autobiography," then we need more slobs in the world. This quirky, slender book describes how Chesterton came to view orthodox Catholic Christianity as the way to satisfy his personal emotional needs, in a way that would also allow him to live happily in society. Chesterton argues that people in western society need a life of "practical romance, the combination of something that is strange with something that is secure. We need so to view the world as to combine an idea of wonder and an idea of welcome." Drawing on such figures as Fra Angelico, George Bernard Shaw, and St. Paul to make his points, Chesterton argues that submission to ecclesiastical authority is the way to achieve a good and balanced life. The whole book is written in a style that is as majestic and down-to-earth as C.S. Lewis at his best. The final chapter, called "Authority and the Adventurer," is especially persuasive. It's hard to imagine a reader who will not close the book believing, at least for the moment, that the Church will make you free. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>In the past few hundred years, some great Christian thinkers, pioneers, radicals and visionaries have penned works of literature that continue to influence Christians today.

He writes and reviews films regularly for major press publications.David Selznick (1902-1965) was 20 when his father, a high-rolling silent film producer/distributor, went bankrupt. Bent on fame, wealth and publicity, the precocious son who had served his domineering father as a sorcerer's apprentice would actually surpass his father. In his entertaining, prodigiously researched biography, Thomson characterizes Selznick as an arrogant manipulator, a megalomaniac hooked on Benzedrine, a brash charmer who believed he was pursuing perfection as a noble aim neglected by Hollywood. A walking contradiction, the highly sexed mogul made a pass at nearly every woman he employed but shied away from the erotic on screen. The self-educated high-school dropout produced Anna Karenina, David Copperfield, Dinner at Eight, Gone with the Wind and King Kong. Thomson, a novelist and author of A Biographical Dictionary of Film, has written a scintillating bio that includes glimpses of Garbo, Hepburn, Gable, Olivier, Dietrich, Graham Greene, Alfred Hitchcock and dozens of others. The book follows Selznick's trajectory from expansive creator to suspicious negotiator preoccupied with a fear of failure. Photos.

The tales first appeared in Sanskrit as the <em>Baital-Pachisi</em>, a collection of Hindu stories told by the baital (a vampire or mischievous spirit). They center on the adventures of the great King Vikram--the King Arthur of the East--who has promised delivery of the vampire to a magician. Pulling the vampire out of a tree, Vikram stuffs him in a sack and sets off on his journey. But the loquacious baital has his own designs and proceeds to instruct the king with a series of tales of the deception, villainy, and folly of human beings.

Painstakingly restored and translated, these fragments came to be known collectively as the Nag Hammadi library. Through them we glimpse a fascinating alternative perspective on Jesus and many of his earliest followers, including the influence of Gnosticism on their beliefs.</p><p>"Gnosticism," a term alluding to special mystical knowledge, designates a series of religious movements that have existed since ancient times. This philosophy permeated Judaism, Greco-Roman religion, and what now appear to be different varieties of Christianity. Some of these alternative views, including Jesus&#x2019;s relationship to Mary Magdalene, have revolutionized biblical scholarship and were recently sensationalized by Dan Brown in his bestseller, <em>The Da Vinci Code</em>.</p><p>The struggle to publish these ancient manuscripts has at times seemed like an ancient story of Egyptian magic -- filled with curses and drama. Included in these discoveries are several gospels of Jesus&#x2019;s life that never made it into the modern Christian Bible as well as a treasury of lost, esoteric wisdom that portrays a side of Christianity suppressed by the institutionalized church. Meyer provides an overview of all the texts and their contents, grouping the codices by their respective genres, schools of thought, or attributed author, and discussing their meaning and significance for us today.

Among his recent books are <em>The Gospel of Judas</em>, <em>The Gnostic Gospels of Jesus</em>, <em>The Gospels of Mary</em>, <em>The Gospel of Thomas</em>, and <em>The Nag Hammadi Scriptures</em>.</p>Before the discovery of the Nag Hammadi documents in the 1940s, Gnosticism was considered to be a form of anti-Christian heresy taught by some early church fathers and condemned by others. Modern readers depended on secondary works condemning Gnosticism in order to understand its proponents' point of view. But with the unearthing of the Gnostic texts at Nag Hammadi, scholars have a better idea of the scope and direction of Gnostic teaching in the early years of Christianity as told by its adherents. Meyer, professor of Bible and Christian studies at Chapman University in California, boasts nine previous publications on the subject and demonstrates a deep understanding of both the history and content of the documents. After briefly recounting their discovery, he analyzes their content, sorting through the teachings and relating them, not just to the biblical text, but even to the bestselling novel <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>. Although there is no new material, the author's concise presentation will appeal to many readers. Meyer writes clearly, bringing both the people and the times of the early Gnostic writings to life and making them accessible to scholar and layperson alike. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

And at first this dead body, sprawled in the parking lot of Motel 17, looks pretty run of the mill: the corpse has a big bootprint on his neck, and the likely suspect is his lover's outraged husband. But the lover has gone missing. And then Delorme, following a hunch, locates another missing woman, a senator's wife from Ottawa, frozen in the ruins of an abandoned hotel way back in the woods. Spookily, she was chained up and abandoned wearing a new winter parka and boots, with a thermos beside her--as if her murderer was giving her a whisper of a chance at survival.<br>&nbsp;<br>Neither Delorme nor Cardinal can imagine where their investigation will lead: into a decades-old injustice committed in the high Arctic; into the swingers' world inhabited by an ex-rock star who owns a pub in Algonquin Bay as well as private members' clubs in Toronto and Ottawa; into the insecurity that afflicts Delorme, the woman and the cop; and into the deep bond between Delorme and Cardinal, which is at real risk of coming undone.<br>&nbsp;<br>In <i>Until the Night</i>, Giles Blunt outdoes himself, creating a masterpiece of crime fiction that will not only haunt his fans and readers, but delight and amaze them too.</p></p><p>GILES BLUNT grew up in North Bay, Ontario.

It builds on the material presented in <i>The Shotokan Karate Bible</i> (see Bibliography) and contains the knowledge that a first-degree black belt (shodan) needs to possess in order to progress to the second-degree black belt level (nidan). Studying from a book is no substitute for a good teacher, but it can complement training in the dojo.</p> <p><b>Beyond Black Belt</b><br> Acquiring the black belt is not the end of your karate training. The black belt levels continue beyond the first degree as shown below.</p> <p><b>Black Belt Levels</b></p> <p><b><i>Dan</i></b> -- <b><i>Level name</i></b><br> 1st -- shodan<br> 2nd -- nidan<br> 3rd -- sandan<br> 4th -- yondan<br> 5th -- godan<br> 6th -- rokudan<br> 7th -- sichidan<br> 8th -- hachidan<br> 9th -- kudan<br> 10th -- judan</p> <p>In some karate organizations, the highest dan grades wear a different-colored belt, for example a red and black belt. However, in most karate schools, there are no new belt colors for the advanced student and all the dan grades wear the black belt. It is, however, often possible to identify a more advanced student. Most black belts are actually made of white cotton and are simply wrapped in black silk. Each time the belt is put on and taken off, a small amount of silk is worn away. Over the years this can result in the belt losing its black color and becoming increasingly white.</p> <p>Some karate practitioners put tags on their black belt to indicate their rank, or have their rank written on the belt, either in their native language or in Japanese characters.</p> <p><b>The Advanced Karate Syllabus</b></p> <p>The syllabus to reach the first-degree black belt level is listed in the Appendices and covered in detail in <i>The Shotokan Karate Bible</i>. The syllabus to progress to second-degree black belt (nidan) is summarized below and explained in detail in this book. The basics (kihon) vary from organization to organization, but are essentially the same as the previous level with the addition of some double-kick combinations. Sparring (kumite) follows the same form as the previous level, but of course you will be expected to perform with greater skill. The primary difference is the kata. You will be expected to know all of the brown belt kata and, in addition, you will need to learn one of the first dan optional kata.</p> <p>The best kata to choose for your second dan grading will depend on your specific strengths and preferences, but Nijushiho is generally recommended. This offers a good balance of new techniques and dynamic moves while not being overly athletic in its demands.</p> <p><b>Black Belt Grading Syllabus, 1st Dan to 2nd Dan</b></p> <p><b><i>Basics</i></b><br> Triple punch - Kizami-zuki, oi-zuki, gyaku-zuki<br> Front kick combination - Mae-geri, oi-zuki, gyaku-zuki<br> Side thrusting kick combination - Yoko kekomi, uraken-uchi, gyaku-zuki<br> Roundhouse kick combination - Mawashi-geri, uraken-uchi, gyaku-zuki<br> Back kick combination - Ushiro-geri, uraken-uchi, gyaku-zuki<br> Front kick/roundhouse kick combination - Mae-geri, mawashi-geri, uraken-uchi, gyaku-zuki<br> Roundhouse kick/side thrusting kick combination - Mawashi-geri, yoko kekomi, urakenuchi, gyaku-zuki<br> Roundhouse kick/reverse-back roundhouse kick combination - Mawashi-geri, ushiro ura mawashigeri, uraken-uchi, gyaku-zuki<br> Front kick/back kick combination - Mae-geri, ushiro-geri, uraken-uchi, gyaku-zuki<br> Four-kick combination - Mae-geri, move front foot back, yoko kekomi, mawashi-geri, ushiro-geri, uraken-uchi, gyaku-zuki<br> Standing kicks - Mae-geri, yoko kekomi, ushiro-geri, mawashi-geri<br> Shodan combination - Mae-geri, oi-zuki, gyaku-zuki, step back gedan barai, gyaku-zuki, mawashi geri, uraken-uchi, oi-zuki</p> <p><b><i>Kata</i></b><br> Kihon Kata (Taikyoku Shodan)<br> Heian Shodan<br> Heian Nidan<br> Heian Sandan<br> Heian Yondan<br> Heian Godan<br> Tekki Shodan<br> Bassai Dai<br> Kanku Dai<br> Jion<br> Empi<br> Hangetsu<br> Choose one from:<br> Bassai Sho, Kanku Sho, Jitte, Nijushiho, Tekki Nidan</p> <p><b><i>Kumite</i></b><br> One-step free sparring - Jiyu ippon kumite<br> Head-level stepping punch - Jodan oi-zuki<br> Stomach-level stepping punch - Chudan oi-zuki<br> Front kick - Mae-geri<br> Side thrusting kick - Yoko kekomi<br> Roundhouse kick - Mawashi-geri<br> Back kick - Ushiro-geri<br> Free sparring - Jiyu kumite</p> <p><b>The Shotokan Kata List</b><br> For all gradings below fifth dan, there is an optional kata list from which the candidate must choose one kata to perform and a compulsory list from which the examiner may select any for the candidate to perform. Those grading to fifth dan or above are expected to know all the Shotokan kata.</p> <p>Compulsory kata are sometimes called shitei (assigned) kata. This is the name often given to the kata you're asked to perform in the early elimination rounds of kata competitions.</p> <p>Optional kata are sometimes called tokui (specialty) kata. This should be the kata that you have focused on and practiced the most. As a lower grade, you probably wouldn't have had a specialty kata. If you did, it was probably Bassai Dai -- the kata you needed to pass your brown belt gradings. As an advanced student, you will be expected to choose a specialty kata that particularly interests you or that suits your particular strengths. In kata competitions, the later rounds are often decided on the basis of your tokui kata.</p> <p><b>Optional and Compulsory Kata</b></p> <p><b><i>Compulsory for 1st Dan and Above</i></b><br> Heian Shodan<br> Heian Nidan<br> Heian Sandan<br> Heian Yondan<br> Heian Godan<br> Tekki Shodan</p> <p><b><i>Optional for 1st Dan; Compulsory for 2nd Dan and Above</i></b><br> Bassai Dai<br> Kanku Dai<br> Jion<br> Empi<br> Hangetsu</p> <p><b><i>Optional for 2nd Dan; Compulsory for 3rd Dan and Above</i></b><br> Bassai Sho<br> Kanku Sho<br> Jitte<br> Nijushiho<br> Tekki Nidan</p> <p><b><i>Optional for 3rd Dan; Compulsory for 4th Dan and Above</i></b><br> Chinte<br> Gankanku<br> Gojushiho Sho<br> Sochin<br> Unsu</p> <p><b><i>Optional for 4th Dan; Compulsory for 5th Dan and Above</i></b><br> Gojushiho Dai<br> Ji'in<br> Meikyo<br> Tekki Sandan<br> Wankan</p> <p><b>The Advanced Student</b><br> It is sometimes said that Shotokan karate trains the "best white belts" in the world, but this is not meant as a compliment.

Lee shows wannabe winners of every level how to compete intelligently, lose gracefully, win frequently, stay focused, and achieve goals in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles. This hip, engaging guide to the game is designed to turn you into the player to beat--in basements, bar leagues, local tournaments, and beyond.</p><p>Jeanette Lee, a.k.a. the Black Widow, is one of the hottest players on the women's professional pool tour. While some critics maintain she's a star only because she's beautiful, with her long, black hair and tight-fitting, fashionable clothes, Lee has the skills to live up to her fierce persona. In <i>The Black Widow's Guide to Killer Pool</i>, Lee shares how she became the player to beat and helps readers improve their game. Part one explains the fundamentals of pool--from how to grip the cue and develop a smooth, level stroke to how to select a cue and a table. She also offers up practice drills for accuracy and control, games (straight pool, eight ball, and nine ball--"by far the sexiest game"), and even a few trick shots to practice. Mastering these skills should let you beat the boss, your uncle Fred, and even the guy down at the corner bar. The next part focuses on the mental aspects of competition--key for a game that is, in Lee's estimation, "90 percent mental, 10 percent on the table." In it she discusses how to get into the zone and how to develop a winning attitude. She also addresses practical matters, such as how to find tournaments, and describes her match day preparations. <p> Without a lot of practice, you'll not likely be following Lee onto a professional tour. But with Lee's help you will be able to gain confidence and play to win. Remember, "Every shot, whether you make it or miss it, is a step toward something better." This book is an excellent first step. <i>--M. Stein</i></p>"Jeanette Lee is a natural, like Wayne Gretzky, Babe Ruth, or Michael Jordan.

Cromwell heralds the inauguration of two hundred years of Protestant dominance, throughout which many of the Irish people were impoverished and dispossessed. Dublin is made a Protestant capital, and Catholics become an underclass. Set against the dramatic backdrop of Irish political history, this powerful saga is brought to its conclusion. Journeying through the centuries right the way up to the twentieth century&#39;s Easter Rising and Independence, passing through turbulent milestones such as The Year of the French, the Famine and The Home Rule Movement of Parnell along the way.</p><p>Edward Rutherfurd was born in Salisbury, Wiltshire, and educated at Cambridge University and Stanford University in California.

Does the beauty of intricately embellished Victorian piecework make your heart race? If so, you will be positively amazed at this comprehensive collection of &#39;Stitcheries&#39; commonly found embroidered on antique crazyquilts. In addition to the antique styles, you will also find many examples of stitches by Carole Samples, collector and lover of all things &#39;crazy&#39;. The author presents 50 basic stitches and so many variations of those stitches that you may never run out of ideas and designs to try on your own projects. This book takes you on a journey from simple straight stitches and blanket stitches to chevrons and herringbones. The &#39;patch picture&#39; designs feature floral bouquets, insects, animals, and much, much more. The old-fashioned script alphabet provides just the right touch for personalizing all your own creations. Whether you are an avid collector of crazyquilts or are just beginning to study and admire them, this book belongs on your shelf. You are sure to acquire a renewed appreciation for antique crazyquilts and their makers.</p><p>Nebraska-born crazyquilt artist Carole Samples taught herself to sew on her grandmother&#39;s 1891 treadle machine when she was 12 years old. Her partnership with that tempermental relic resulted in a closet full of cotton dresses and nylon-net petticoats, and fostered an ever-growing appreciation of - and affection for - beautiful textiles.In 1981, Dorothy Bond self-published Crazy Quilt Stitches, perhaps the first compilation of sketches of embroidery stitches found on the seams of old crazy-patch quilts. For two decades, the "brown book," as it came to be called, was a valuable source for designers of crazy quilts. Continuing that tradition, Samples has collected and classified thousands of decorative stitches, both antique stitch combinations and new stitches of her own creation. Like its predecessor, this treasury is a collection of stitch and stitch combination drawings--not a "how-to" or project book. Samples's extensive "Crazyquilter's Reading List" refers the reader to other books on embroidery techniques with specific information on forming the stitches and to project books for patterns and photographs of crazy quilts. A recommended reference source for embroidery and quilting collections in public and academic settings. <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Story of Astronomy</h2><p>From the ancient origins of astronomy to the Copernican revolution, and from Galileo to Hawking&#39;s research into black holes, &#34;The Story of Astronomy&#34; charts the discoveries of some of the greatest minds in human history, and their attempts to unveil the secrets of the stars.

Now, nine years later, with worldwide interest in Italian food booming and a new Italian cuisine emerging, this new book has new power to satisfy the cook and traveler in us all. <p> With the accelerated pace of contemporary life, Italians have had to change their style of eating. This has created fresh ideas, quick approaches to the classics, rediscovered heritage dishes, and a more relaxed way of assembling menus. This new style is reflected in the more than 220 recipes culled from cooks throughout Italy. Emphasis is on light first courses and vegetable dishes; simply prepared fish, poultry and meats; and homemade breads, pizzas and desserts. Photographs of each region accompany these mouthwatering recipes. From the Alps to Sicily, from the fragrant herbs of Liguria to the pungent olives of Puglia, readers will delight in rediscovering the pleasures of this inspiring beloved country.</p></p><p><i>Italy Today, the Beautiful Cookbook</i> is the third volume on Italian cooking to join the popular Beautiful series of large format, lavishly illustrated books from HarperCollins. It is more than just a pretty book to set on the coffee table; this is a book cooks will enjoy and one that makes good reading if you are planning a trip to Italy. <p> Fred Plotkin's text covers the history, economy, and particular ingredients important in each of Italy's culinary regions. He also explains how changes in the way Italians live are affecting how they eat. Meals, for example, now follow the traditional structure less rigidly in most parts of the country, with the southern areas holding closest to the old ways. Also, while cooking in Italy is still remarkably regional, people are enjoying recipes less tied to their locality. Use of fresh and local ingredients, however, remains strong. </p><p> The recipes are by Lorenza De' Medici, who also did the food for <i>Italy, the Beautiful Cookbook</i> and <i>Tuscany, the Beautiful Cookbook</i>. Here she offers 220 dishes. Some show how Italians are modifying classics; others illustrate the living quality of Italian cooking in its acceptance of new ingredients and in new ways of using familiar ones. Perfect examples of this are Eggplant with Yogurt and Mint and Rice Salad with Pesto. Beyond all the handsome photographs, this is a source cooks really can use.</p>Lorenza de Medici has published more than 30 cookbooks. She has appeared in a 13-part series on Italian cooking for public television and conducts a cooking school at Badia a Coltibuono, an 11th-century estate and winery near the Chianti region of Tuscany. She divides her time between Milan and Badia a Coltibuono.</p><h2>1917: Lenin, Wilson, and the Birth of the New World Disorder</h2><p><p><strong>This is the story of two men, and the two decisions, that transformed world history in a single tumultuous year, 1917: Wilson&#x2019;s entry into World War One and Lenin&#x2019;s Bolshevik Revolution.&nbsp; </strong></p><p>In April 1917 Woodrow Wilson, champion of American democracy but also segregation; advocate for free trade and a new world order based on freedom and justice; thrust the United States into World War One in order to make the &#x201c;world safe for democracy&#x201d;&#x2014;only to see his dreams for a liberal international system dissolve into chaos, bloodshed, and betrayal.&nbsp; </p><p>That October Vladimir Lenin, communist revolutionary and advocate for class war and &#x201c;dictatorship of the proletariat,&#x201d; would overthrow Russia&#x2019;s earlier democratic revolution that had toppled the all-power Czar, all in the name of liberating humanity&#x2014;and instead would set up the most repressive totalitarian regime in history, the Soviet Union. </p><p>In this incisive, fast-paced history, New York Times bestselling author Arthur Herman brilliantly reveals how Lenin and Wilson rewrote the rules of modern geopolitics.

Ranging from the Caribbean to Vietnam to the American Midwest and spanning decades of tumultuous history, these books are both unforgettable narratives and indelible portraits of people in extremis, struggling to survive in a world marked by grief, loss, pain, trauma, and homicidal madness. The four stories gathered here are offshoots of that larger fictional universe. Each one stands entirely on its own. Together, they shine a revelatory light on the mysteries and hidden corners of the novels that inspired them.<br><br>"Blue Rose" recounts a defining moment in the childhood of Koko's Harry Beevers, the moment when the ten-year-old Harry discovers his capacity for violence and brutality. "The Juniper Tree" describes, with almost unbearable clarity, a lonely young boy's encounter with adult betrayal, and with the darker aspects of human sexuality. "The Ghost Village" takes us to the phantasmagoric landscape of Vietnam, where the barriers between the living and the dead begin to dissolve, to mesmerizing effect. "Bunny is Good Bread" is arguably Straub's single most harrowing story. With relentless attention to detail, it anatomizes the creation of a human monster through abuse, cruelty, and neglect.<br><br>These disturbing, beautifully written stories have a moral weight and emotional resonance that only the finest fiction achieves. They are the clear product of a master storyteller at the very top of his game. No one who reads them is likely to forget them, or come away unchanged.</p><p>Starred Review. Stoker winner Straub pays a deliciously macabre visit to the universe of his expansive Blue Rose trilogy (Koko, Mystery, The Throat). In attics ("Blue Rose"), movie theaters ("The Juniper Tree"), sickrooms ("Bunny Is Good Bread"), and the jungles of Vietnam ("The Ghost Village"), a touch of the supernatural heightens the horror of purely human cruelty that turns innocents into victims and warps victims into monsters. Though newcomers will find the collection easily accessible, Blue Rose fans will especially enjoy the further exploration of familiar characters and their horribly formative childhood years. Readers of dark fiction will not want to miss this chilling addition to Straub's extensive bibliography. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For many years, while Nelson Mandela was in prison, Archbishop Tutu was the focus of hope for racial justice in South Africa. Even today, Tutu is the principal representative of the peacemakers and a beloved and well-known figure to North Americans. The first entry in this collection is Tutu&#39;s moving letter as a young priest to South Africa&#39;s then-Prime Minister Vorster, pleading with him (as a grandfather who loved his grandchildren) to take pity on non-white South Africans and dismantle the injustice of apartheid. The second entry is Tutu&#39;s thrilling sermon at the grave Steven Biko. So it goes: At each turn in the story South Africa&#39;s anti-apartheid movement, Tutu is there, guiding and shaping the events with his words, and with the sheer moral force of his immensely power presence, so that this book becomes a kind of demonstration in how to conduct a peaceful revolution -- how to construct the words that will lead people in the direction of justice and not just toward counter-injustice. The entries by Tutu are linked to one another crisp and informative narrative, written by John Allen, a courageous and respected journalist and (since 1987) the Archbishop&#39;s media secretary, which makes the whole into a &#34;You Are There&#34; documentary history of the apartheid movement, with Archbishop Tutu as its focus.inbow People Of God traces South Africa&#39;s glorious victory over apartheid in the writings and speeches of one its central figures, Archbishop Desmond Tutu. From the graveside of Steven Biko to the triumphant inauguration of Nelson Mandela as President of South Africa, Tutu&#39;s words and presence helped shape events and led South Africa toward justice and freedom. This astonishing tapestry of narrative is not only a valuable historical document of those significant events, but it also showcases the unique sense of spirit of one of the foremost spiritual leaders in the world. Tested through the greatest adversity, these writings will endure for generations to come by their truly powerful combination of compassion and strength.</p><h2>United Methodist Church Book of Discipline 2016</h2><p>official United Methodist Book of Discipline 2016</p><p></p><h2>Uncle John&#39;s Great Big Bathroom Reader</h2><p>One of Uncle John&#x2019;s all-time biggest sellers, <i>Great Big</i> is overflowing with everything our fans have come to expect: urban legends, forgotten history, myth-conceptions, business blunders, strange lawsuits, weird politics, amazing origins, dumb crooks, celebrity gossip, brain teasers, short facts, and more!

However, he feels no real calling-despite his lively faith-and he turns to the profession of surgeon, training in Paris and then hanging his sign in Oxford. Soon after, a local lord asks Hugh de Singleton to track the killer of a young woman whose bones have been found in the castle cesspool. Through his medical knowledge, Singleton identifies her as the impetuous missing daughter of a local blacksmith. The young man she loved-whom she had provoked very publicly-is quickly arrested and sentenced at Oxford. But this is just the beginning of the tale. The story of Singleton's adventure unfolds with realistic medical procedures, droll medieval wit, romantic distractions, and a consistent underlying sense of Christian compassion. <p>&#x201c;Thoughtful and curious, surgeon Hugh is an engaging character who feels totally real.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Rikki B.</p> <p>&#x201c;I enjoyed the setting, period, the very realistic characters and the dry wit.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Donna B. </p> <p>&#x201c;I read all of it in one go - quite the best medieval mystery I've read in a while.

According to census figures, the number of women among the ranks of professional artists rose from 10 percent to nearly 50 percent between 1870 and 1890. Examining the effects of this change, Kirsten Swinth explores how women's growing presence in the American art world transformed both its institutions and its ideology.<br><br>Swinth traces the careers of women painters in New York, Philadelphia, and Boston, opening and closing her book with discussion of the two most famous women artists of the period--Mary Cassatt and Georgia O'Keeffe. Perhaps surprisingly, Swinth shows that in the 1870s and 1880s men and women easily crossed the boundaries separating conventionally masculine and feminine artistic territories to compete with each other as well as to join forces to professionalize art training, manage a fluid and unpredictable art market, and shape the language of art criticism. By the 1890s, however, women artists faced a backlash. Ultimately, Swinth argues, these gender contests spilled beyond the world of art to shape twentieth-century understandings of high culture and the formation of modernism in profound ways.<br><br></p><p>"The manoeuvres, successes and failures of American women artists are engagingly narrated. Swinth relies on lively documentary evidence supplied by diaries, letters and contemporary criticism."-- <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> <br>Kirsten Swinth is associate professor of history and director of the American Studies Program at Fordham University.</p><h2>Krishna in the Sky with Diamonds: The Bhagavad Gita as Psychedelic Guide</h2><p>A verse-by-verse examination of Arjuna&#x2019;s soma experience and Krishna&#x2019;s psychedelic guidance in the Bhagavad Gita <br> <br>ï¿½ Explains how the Bhagavad Gita provides complete guidelines for the spiritual use of entheogens--from prior mental preparations to the integration of profound visionary insights into everyday consciousness <br> <br>ï¿½ Examines Chapter XI of the Gita in detail to illuminate Arjuna&#x2019;s hallucinogenic experience and expose Krishna as the ultimate psychedelic guide <br> <br>ï¿½ Shows psychedelic experience to be an essential and ancient part of the path to spiritual transformation <br> <br>Known as a text of liberation and enlightenment and praised not only by Indians but also by prominent modern thinkers such as Aldous Huxley and Albert Einstein, the Bhagavad Gita is one of the most commented-upon books of all time, yet one aspect has never before been examined: Arjuna&#x2019;s psychedelic soma experience with his guru Krishna. <br> <br>Drawing upon his many years as a student of Nitya Chaitanya Yati, whose teacher was Gita scholar Nataraja Guru, preeminent disciple of Narayana Guru, Scott Teitsworth explains how the Bhagavad Gita, through the story of the hero Arjuna and his guru Krishna, provides complete guidelines for the spiritual use of entheogens, from prior mental preparations to the integration of profound visionary insights into everyday consciousness.

His mother, Stella, was a painter who numbered among her friends Jackson Pollock and Louise Nevelson; she despised the affluent lifestyle her husband cultivated and viewed his taking a job with her father's lighting-fixture company as a betrayal. Before and after their divorce, writes Fred Waitzkin, "Mother and Dad warred within me." His unsparing memoir depicts a larger war within the family waged by grandparents, aunts and uncles, and his own brother, who fled from their parents' troubles into a bohemian, self-destructive life. Young Fred embraced orthodox Judaism and "cultivated [his] conventional side" to emulate Abe, yet he also dreamed of being a writer. Through it all, fishing--beloved by Abe, despised by Stella--remained his escape and his comfort. Waitzkin, who proved with <i>Searching for Bobby Fischer</i> that he could use the particulars of an avocation to illuminate the emotional needs it assuaged, does the same here with wonderfully evocative details about fishing. A closing scene chronicling a 1998 hunt for tuna with his wife and two children tentatively suggests that this generation of Waitzkins has found some measure of the happiness that eluded Abe and Stella. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Fred Waitzkin, who fishes regularly in the Bahamas, is the author of <i>Searching for Bobby Fischer</i> and has written for <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>, <i>New York</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Sports Illustrated</i>, and <i>Motorboating and Sailing</i>.

So I didn&#x2019;t know that it was one night shy of being full when a young woman sat down across from me in McAnally&#x2019;s pub and asked me to tell her all about something that could get her killed.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Absolutely not.&#x201d; I folded the piece of paper, with its drawings of three concentric rings of spidery symbols, and slid it back over the polished oak-wood table.</p><p>Kim Delaney frowned at me, and brushed some of her dark, shining hair back from her forehead. She was a tall woman, buxom and lovely in an old-world way, with pale, pretty skin and round cheeks well used to smiling. She wasn&#x2019;t smiling now.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, come on, Harry,&#x201d; she told me. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re Chicago&#x2019;s only practicing professional wizard, and you&#x2019;re the only one who can help me.&#x201d; She leaned across the table toward me, her eyes intent. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t find the references for all of these symbols. No one in local circles recognizes them either. You&#x2019;re the only real wizard I&#x2019;ve ever even heard of, much less know. I just want to know what these others are.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want to know. You&#x2019;re better off forgetting this circle and concentrating on something else.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Mac caught my attention from behind the bar by waving a hand at me, and slid a couple of plates of steaming food onto the polished surface of the crooked oak bar. He added a couple of bottles of his homemade brown ale, and my mouth started watering.</p><p>My stomach made an unhappy noise. It was almost as empty as my wallet. I would never have been able to afford dinner tonight, except that Kim had offered to buy, if I&#x2019;d talk to her about something during the meal. A steak dinner was less than my usual rate, but she was pleasant company, and a sometime apprentice of mine. I knew she didn&#x2019;t have much money, and I had even less.</p><p>Despite my rumbling stomach, I didn&#x2019;t rise immediately to pick up the food. (In McAnally&#x2019;s pub and grill, there aren&#x2019;t any service people. According to Mac, if you can&#x2019;t get up and walk over to pick up your own order, you don&#x2019;t need to be there at all.) I looked around the room for a moment, with its annoying combination of low ceilings and lazily spinning fans, its thirteen carved wooden columns and its thirteen windows, plus thirteen tables arranged haphazardly to defray and scatter the residual magical effects that sometimes surrounded hungry (in other words, angry) wizards. McAnally&#x2019;s was a haven in a town where no one believed in magic. A lot of the crowd ate there.</p><p>&#x201c;Look, Harry,&#x201d; Kim said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not using this for anything serious, I promise. I&#x2019;m not trying any summoning or binding. It&#x2019;s an academic interest only. Something that&#x2019;s been bothering me for a while.&#x201d; She leaned forward and put her hand over mine, looking me in the face without looking me in the eyes, a trick that few nonpractitioners of the Art could master. She grinned and showed me the deep dimples in her cheeks.</p><p>My stomach growled again, and I glanced over at the food on the bar, waiting for me. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re sure?&#x201d; I asked her. &#x201c;This is just you trying to scratch an itch? You&#x2019;re not using it for anything?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Cross my heart,&#x201d; she said, doing so.</p><p>I frowned. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know . . .&#x201d;</p><p>She laughed at me. &#x201c;Oh, come <i>on,</i> Harry. It&#x2019;s no big deal. Look, if you don&#x2019;t want to tell me, never mind. I&#x2019;ll buy you dinner anyway. I know you&#x2019;re tight for money lately. Since that thing last spring, I mean.&#x201d;</p><p>I glowered, but not at Kim. It wasn&#x2019;t her fault that my main employer, Karrin Murphy, the director of Special Investigations at the Chicago Police Department, hadn&#x2019;t called me in for consulting work in more than a month. Most of my living for the past few years had come from serving as a special consultant to SI, but after a fracas last spring involving a dark wizard fighting a gang war for control of Chicago&#x2019;s drug trade, work with SI had slowly tapered off&#x2014;and with it, my income.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t know why Murphy hadn&#x2019;t been calling me in as often. I had my suspicions, but I hadn&#x2019;t gotten the chance to confront her about them yet. Maybe it wasn&#x2019;t anything I&#x2019;d done. Maybe the monsters had gone on strike. Yeah, right.</p><p>The bottom line was I was strapped for cash. I&#x2019;d been eating ramen noodles and soup for too many weeks. The steaks Mac had prepared smelled like heaven, even from across the room. My belly protested again, growling its neolithic craving for charred meat.</p><p>But I couldn&#x2019;t just go and eat the dinner without giving Kim the information she wanted. It&#x2019;s not that I&#x2019;ve never welshed on a deal, but I&#x2019;ve never done it with anyone human&#x2014;and definitely not with someone who looked up to me.</p><p>Sometimes I hate having a conscience, and a stupidly thorough sense of honor.</p><p>&#x201c;All right, all right,&#x201d; I sighed. &#x201c;Let me get the dinner and I&#x2019;ll tell you what I know.&#x201d;</p><p>Kim&#x2019;s round cheeks dimpled again. &#x201c;Thanks, Harry. This means a lot to me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, yeah,&#x201d; I told her, and got up to weave my way toward the bar, through columns and tables and so on. McAnally&#x2019;s had more people than usual tonight, and though Mac rarely smiled, there was a contentment to his manner that indicated that he was happy with the crowd. I snatched up the plates and bottles with a somewhat petulant attitude. It&#x2019;s hard to take much joy in a friend&#x2019;s prosperity when your own business is about to go under.</p><p>I took the food, steaks and potatoes and green beans, back to the table and sat down again, placing Kim&#x2019;s plate in front of her. We ate for a while, myself in sullen silence and she in hearty hunger.</p><p>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; Kim said, finally. &#x201c;What can you tell me about that?&#x201d; She gestured toward the piece of paper with her fork.</p><p>I swallowed my food, took a sip of the rich ale, and picked up the paper again. &#x201c;All right. This is a figure of High magic. Three of them, really, one inside the other, like layered walls. Remember what I told you about magical circles?&#x201d;</p><p>Kim nodded. &#x201c;They either hold something out or keep it in. Most work on magic energies or creatures of the Nevernever, but mortal creatures can cross the circles and break them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what this outermost circle of symbols is. It&#x2019;s a barrier against creatures of spirit and magical forces. These symbols here, here, here, are the key ones.&#x201d; I pointed out the squiggles in question.</p><p>Kim nodded eagerly. &#x201c;I got the outer one. What&#x2019;s the next?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The second circle is more of a spell barrier to <i>mortal</i> flesh. It wouldn&#x2019;t work if all you used was a ring of symbols. You&#x2019;d need something else, stones or gems or something, spaced between the drawings.&#x201d; I took another bite of steak.</p><p>Kim frowned at the paper, and then at me. &#x201c;And then what would that do?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Invisible wall,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;Like bricks. Spirits, magic, could go right through it, but mortal flesh couldn&#x2019;t. Neither could a thrown rock, bullets, anything purely physical.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I see,&#x201d; she said, excited. &#x201c;Sort of a force field.&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded. &#x201c;Something like that.&#x201d;</p><p>Her cheeks glowed with excitement, and her eyes shone. &#x201c;I <i>knew</i> it. And what&#x2019;s this last one?&#x201d;</p><p>I squinted at the innermost ring of symbols, frowning. &#x201c;A mistake.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I mean that it&#x2019;s just gobbledygook. It doesn&#x2019;t mean anything useful. Are you sure you copied this correctly?&#x201d;</p><p>Kim&#x2019;s mouth twisted into a frown. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure, I&#x2019;m sure. I was careful.&#x201d;</p><p>I studied her face for a moment. &#x201c;If I read the symbols correctly, it&#x2019;s a third wall. Built to withhold creatures of flesh <i>and</i> spirit. Neither mortal nor spirit but somewhere in between.&#x201d;</p><p>She frowned. &#x201c;What kind of creatures are like that?&#x201d;</p><p>I shrugged. &#x201c;None,&#x201d; I said, and officially, it was true. The White Council of wizards did not allow the discussion of demons that could be called to earth, beings of spirit that could gather flesh to themselves. Usually, a spirit-circle was enough to stop all but the most powerful demons or Elder Things of the outer reaches of the Nevernever. But this third circle was built to stop things that could transcend those kinds of boundaries. It was a cage for demonic demigods and archangels.</p><p>Kim wasn&#x2019;t buying my answer. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see why anyone would make a circle like this to contain nothing, Harry.&#x201d;</p><p>I shrugged. &#x201c;People don&#x2019;t always do reasonable, sensible things. They&#x2019;re like that.&#x201d;</p><p>She rolled her eyes at me. &#x201c;Come on, Harry. I&#x2019;m not a baby. You don&#x2019;t have to shelter me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you,&#x201d; I told her, &#x201c;don&#x2019;t need to know what kind of thing that third circle was built to contain. You don&#x2019;t want to know. Trust me.&#x201d;</p><p>She glowered at me for a long moment, then sipped at her ale and shrugged. &#x201c;All right. Circles have to be empowered, right? You have to know how to switch them on, like lights?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Something like that. Sure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How would a person turn this one on?&#x201d;</p><p>I stared at her for a long time.</p><p>&#x201c;Harry?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need to know that, either. Not for an academic interest. I don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;ve got in mind, Kim, but leave it alone. Forget it. Walk away, before you get hurt.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Harry, I am not&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Save it,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re sitting on a tiger cage, Kim.&#x201d; I thumped a finger on the paper for emphasis. &#x201c;And you wouldn&#x2019;t need it if you weren&#x2019;t planning on trying to stick a tiger in there.&#x201d;</p><p>Her eyes glittered, and she lifted her chin. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;m strong enough.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your strength&#x2019;s got nothing to do with it,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have the training. You don&#x2019;t have the knowledge. I wouldn&#x2019;t expect a kid in grade school to be able to sit down and figure out college calculus. And I don&#x2019;t expect it of you, either.&#x201d; I leaned forward. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know enough yet to be toying with this sort of thing, Kim. And even if you did, even if you did manage to become a full-fledged wizard, I&#x2019;d still tell you not to do it. You mess this up and you could get a lot of people hurt.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>If</i> I was planning to do that, it&#x2019;s my business, Harry.&#x201d; Her eyes were bright with anger. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have the right to choose for me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got the responsibility to help you make the right choice.&#x201d; I curled the paper in my fingers and crushed it, then tossed it aside, to the floor. She stabbed her fork into a cut of steak, a sharp, vicious gesture. &#x201c;Look, Kim,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Give it some time. When you&#x2019;re older, when you&#x2019;ve had more experience . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t so much older than me,&#x201d; Kim said.</p><p>I shifted uncomfortably in my seat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had a lot of training. And I started young.&#x201d; My own ability with magic, far in excess of my years and education, wasn&#x2019;t a subject I wanted to explore. So I tried to shift the direction of the conversation. &#x201c;How is this fall&#x2019;s fund-raiser going?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not,&#x201d; she said. She leaned back wearily in her seat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m tired of trying to pry money out of people to save the planet they&#x2019;re poisoning or the animals they&#x2019;re killing. I&#x2019;m tired of writing letters and doing marches for causes no one believes in anymore.&#x201d; She rubbed at her eyes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just tired.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Look, Kim. Try to get some rest. And please, please don&#x2019;t play with that circle. Promise me.&#x201d;</p><p>She tossed her napkin down, left a few bills on the table, and stood up. &#x201c;Enjoy your meal, Harry,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And thanks for nothing.&#x201d;</p><p>I stood up as well. &#x201c;Kim,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Wait a minute.&#x201d;</p><p>But she ignored me. She stalked off toward the door, her skirt swaying along with her long hair. She cut an impressive, statuesque figure. I could feel the anger bubbling off her. One of the ceiling fans shuddered and let out a puff of smoke as she walked under it, then whirled down to a halt. She raced up the short flight of stairs and exited the bar, banging the door shut behind her.

In Chinese Cinderella, Adeline Yen Mah returns to her roots to tell the story of her painful childhood and her ultimate triumph and courage in the face of despair. Adeline's affluent, powerful family considers her bad luck after her mother dies giving birth to her. Life does not get any easier when her father remarries. She and her siblings are subjected to the disdain of her stepmother, while her stepbrother and stepsister are spoiled. Although Adeline wins prizes at school, they are not enough to compensate for what she really yearns for -- the love and understanding of her family.<br><br>Following the success of the critically acclaimed adult bestseller Falling Leaves, this memoir is a moving telling of the classic Cinderella story, with Adeline Yen Mah providing her own courageous voice.</p><p><i>Chinese Cinderella</i> is the perfect title for Adeline Yen Mah's compelling autobiography in which, like the fairy-tale maiden, her childhood was ruled by a cruel stepmother. "Fifth Younger Sister" or "Wu Mei," as Yen Mah was called, is only an infant when her father remarries after her mother's death. As the youngest of her five siblings, Wu Mei suffers the worst at the hands of her stepmother Niang. She is denied carfare, frequently forgotten at school at the end of the day, and whipped for daring to attend a classmate's birthday party against Niang's wishes. Her father even forgets the spelling of her name when filling out her school enrollment record. In her loneliness, Wu Mei turns to books for company: "I was alone with my beloved books. What bliss! To be left in peace with Cordelia, Regan, Gonoril, and Lear himself--characters more real than my family... What happiness! What comfort!" Even though Wu Mei is repeatedly moved up to grades above those of her peers, it is only when she wins an international play-writing contest in high school that her father finally takes notice and grants her wish to attend college in England. Despite her parent's heartbreaking neglect, she eventually becomes a doctor and realizes her dream of being a writer.<p> Teens, with their passionate convictions and strong sense of fair play, will be immediately enveloped in the gross injustice of Adeline Yen Mah's story. A complete glossary, historical notes on the state of Chinese society and politics during Yen Mah's childhood, and the legend of the original Chinese Cinderella round out this stirring testimony to the strength of human character and the power of education.

Acetate dust jacket clean and intact. Bookplate remnant to inner pastedown. Binding tight, inner pages bright. Includes Red Riding Hood pop-up, several fold-outs.;</p><p>In a nutshell, <i>The Art of Maurice Sendak</i> is simply stunning. Page after page of lavish full-color illustrations and black-and-whites from one of America's best-loved children's artists adorn this hefty volume. Sendak, best known for the charming and timeless <i>Where the Wild Things Are</i>, never fails to amuse and astonish with his creative wizardry. He was talented from the cradle, and his early works from the 1940s are given due recognition here--reflecting his fascination with the small intricacies of being human, and his devilish sense of humor. Even a stuffy physics textbook from 1947 is given the Sendak touch, as atoms, molecules, and chain reactions take on the form of people jiving and swinging. Always the artistic adventurer, Sendak experiments with many different forms--from the fairy-tale-like pen-and-ink drawings of <i>Higglety Pigglety Pop!</i> to the beautiful watercolor pieces that illustrate <i>Mr. Rabbit and the Lovely Present</i>. Virtually every page contains another Sendak gem--be it a quick sketch, an exquisite portrait of his mother or sister, or the preliminary drawings from <i>Where the Wild Things Are</i>. Three huge fold-outs make for an extra-special treat.<p> The book's rich text is exemplary--based on interviews, conversations, and extensive research by Sendak's close friend Selma Lanes. The author invites us into the very special world of Maurice Sendak, a place of fantasies and wonderment, a land where adults can be children--and never grow up. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i></p></p><h2>Lost Country Life: How English country folk lived, worked, threshed, thatched, rolled fleece, milled corn, brewed mead...</h2><p>This beautiful and heartfelt encyclopedia of rural life in the middle ages gets its special charm because the author, as a little girl, knew shepherds and laborers who lived in a way hardly changed through the centuries.

Even more amazing, after it's unearthed the artifact releases a powerful signal aimed at Saturn. What sort of alarm has been triggered? To find out, a manned spacecraft, the <i>Discovery</i>, is sent to investigate. Its crew is highly trained--the best--and they are assisted by a self-aware computer, the ultra-capable HAL 9000. But HAL's programming has been patterned after the human mind a little too well. He is capable of guilt, neurosis, even murder, and he controls every single one of <i>Discovery</i>'s components. The crew must overthrow this digital psychotic if they hope to make their rendezvous with the entities that are responsible not just for the monolith, but maybe even for human civilization.<p> Clarke wrote this novel while Stanley Kubrick created the film, the two collaborating on both projects. The novel is much more detailed and intimate, and definitely easier to comprehend.

Although Wendell Lewis&nbsp;Willkie&nbsp;would lose to FDR,&nbsp;acclaimed biographer David Levering Lewis demonstrates&nbsp;that the corporate chairman&#x2013;turned&#x2013;presidential candidate&nbsp;must be regarded as&nbsp;one of the most exciting, intellectually able, and authentically transformational figures to stride the twentieth-century American political landscape.</p><p>Born in Elwood, Indiana, in 1892, Willkie was certainly one of&nbsp;the most&nbsp;unexpected, if not unlikely, candidates for the presidency,&nbsp;only somewhat less unlikely than Barack Hussein Obama. Although previously marginalized by journalists&nbsp;like Theodore H. White and&nbsp;David Halberstam as a political invention of&nbsp;rich newspaper&nbsp;publishers, the&nbsp;Willkie who emerges here&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;man governed by principles who seldom allowed rigid&nbsp;categories to stand in his way. Even as a young man, he&nbsp;quickly distinguished himself as&nbsp;a reform-minded lawyer, whose farm-boy haircut, hayseed manners, and sartorial indifference bespoke common-man straightforwardness but concealed&nbsp;an&nbsp;ambition that propelled him at&nbsp;forty&nbsp;to chairman of Commonwealth and Southern, the&nbsp;country&#x2019;s&nbsp;third-largest private utility holding company.</p><p>It was Willkie&#x2019;s vehement opposition to government regulation of the free-market economy and his success in wrenching a fabulous monetary settlement from the Tennessee Valley Authority that&nbsp;attracted the attention of Republican leaders, who, like&nbsp;Willkie, felt that FDR&nbsp;was turning the office into an imperial presidency. Successful at outwitting the isolationist&nbsp;wing of his own party, Willkie took on&nbsp;Roosevelt during one of the nation&#x2019;s darkest periods, creating an unlikely&nbsp;alliance of supporters, including anti-big-government&nbsp;business leaders and black voters, who rightly felt&nbsp;excluded from New Deal benefits.</p><p>Despite receiving the largest percentage of Republican votes in a generation, Willkie lost but, in the process, proposed&nbsp;sweeping civil rights reform a full generation before the civil rights era&nbsp;and&nbsp;a&nbsp;progressive &#x201c;new&nbsp;conception of the world&#x201d; that&nbsp;remains&nbsp;inspirational at a time when&nbsp;our own national belief system&nbsp;has become alarmingly&nbsp;immoral and&nbsp;rudderless. Rather than continue a political battle that could have weakened the nation during its darkest hour,&nbsp;a&nbsp;defeated&nbsp;Willkie&nbsp;reconciled with the&nbsp;president and embraced the war effort, while writing&nbsp;One World,&nbsp;a visionary credo that&nbsp;hoped to instigate an international movement for the betterment of the world&#x2019;s people. In rejecting&nbsp;America&#x2019;s penchant for&nbsp;exceptionalism, Willkie championed this&nbsp;internationalism more&nbsp;passionately&nbsp;than any American politician before him, creating&nbsp;a sovereign philosophy&nbsp;of&nbsp;liberalism that balanced free enterprise with social responsibility. His&nbsp;untimely death at fifty-two in&nbsp;1944&nbsp;left this prophetic vision tragically stillborn.</p> 30 illustrations</p><p>David Levering Lewis, the author of God&#x2019;s Crucible, is professor emeritus of history at New York University. A recipient of the National Humanities Medal, Lewis received the Pulitzer Prize for each volume of his W.E.B. Du Bois biography. He lives in New York City.&#x201c;Lewis, the Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer of W.E.B. Du Bois, offers an insightful, compelling portrait of this political neophyte from the Midwest...In our own polarized age, Wendell Willkie serves as a poignant reminder of what can happen when a political leader steps up to do what is right, defying his party and putting the interests of his country and its people ahead of ambition and partisan advantage.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Lynne Olson, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The freshest dimension to Lewis&#x2019;s biography comes from the lifetime of scholarship in African-American history which he brings to bear on Willkie&#x2019;s domestic civil-rights efforts.... Lewis brings the now largely unknown Willkie to a new generation.... The book largely succeeds, suggesting a figure&#x2015;again, like Reagan&#x2015;both sunnily approachable and weirdly elusive; one who seems to require imaginative projections.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Thomas Mallon, <i>The New Yorker</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[An] insightful, disciplined biography....In Mr. Lewis&#x2019;s telling, Willkie emerges as the kind of figure who is missing on the political stage today: the classical liberal, who stands for individual rights at home and will fight tyranny abroad.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Amity Shlaes, <i>Wall Street Journal</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In his absorbing and all-too-timely book, David Levering Lewis has painted a compelling portrait of a largely&#x2015;but unjustly&#x2015;forgotten figure, Wendell Willkie. Our politics needs voices like Willkie&#x2019;s&#x2015;someone who is in the arena and who calls them as he sees them, seeking common ground rather than perpetual conflict.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jon Meacham, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <i>The Soul of America: The Battle for Our Better Angels</i> and <i>Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Only the formidably erudite David Levering Lewis, the Voltaire of American letters, could remedy our misunderstanding of a neglected treasure like Wendell Willkie while touting a vibrant liberalism that lifts us beyond the self-defeating narcissism of our social morass to a soaring vision of American politics.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michael Eric Dyson, author of <i>What Truth Sounds Like: Robert F. Kennedy, James Baldwin, and Our Unfinished Conversation About Race in America</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Meticulously researched and brilliantly written... Lewis, one of our nation&#x2019;s most gifted historians, rightfully elevates the devalued Willkie to high-minded Mount Rushmore statesman status. This is American history at its absolute finest!&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Douglas Brinkley, author of <i>Rightful Heritage: Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Land of America</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;At a time when our political system seems alarmingly immoral and rudderless, David Levering Lewis&#x2019;&nbsp;<em>The Improbable Wendell Willkie</em>&nbsp;offers a powerful reminder of practical bipartisanship, visionary internationalism, and committed civil liberties and civil rights.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Katrina vanden Heuvel, Editor &amp; Publisher, <i>The Nation</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In this gorgeously written biography of Wendell Willkie, David Levering Lewis forces us to reconsider everything we thought we knew about Franklin Roosevelt, the New Deal, and America&#x2019;s rise to global power in the twentieth century.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>David Nasaw, author of <i>Andrew Carnegie</i> and <i>The Patriarch: The Remarkable Life and Turbulent Times of Joseph P.

McGrath, <i>Minneapolis Star-Tribune</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This engrossing and enlightening appraisal by a master biographer shows why and how Wendell Willkie mattered.&nbsp; We gain virtuoso access to a thoughtful leader who demonstrated that effective political opposition need not descend into coarse demagoguery or shrill combat.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Ira Katznelson, author of <i>Redemption</i></strong></p><h2>No Hatch to Match: Aggressive Strategies for Fly-Fishing between Hatches</h2><p>The bulk of fly-fishing literature is centered on matching the hatch, when in reality, on most waters, most of the time, there is no hatch to match.

Now Sara Foster shares more than two hundred delicious recipes, providing modern takes on favorite home-style classics.<br> <br>The Foster&#x2019;s Market Cookbook features old-fashioned ideas about how good food should taste and new-fashioned ideas about prep times and the use of high-quality prepared ingredients. Filled with eighty color photos, this is the perfect cookbook to refer to over and over again for everyday meals or for entertaining, whether it be for two or for twenty.<br><br>Before moving to Durham, North Carolina, Sara worked alongside Martha Stewart in the kitchen of Martha&#x2019;s catering business. When she opened her own catering company, Sara kept her food simple yet soulful, trusting the complex flavors of seasonal ingredients. This same basic principle guides the daily offerings at Foster&#x2019;s Markets in Durham and Chapel Hill. Each week the markets serve nearly a thousand customers hungrily searching out Sara&#x2019;s innovative, new-style home cooking. And now food lovers everywhere will be able to prepare with ease sumptuous dishes such as Roasted Chicken, Sweet Potato, and Arugula Salad; Herb-Grilled Salmon with Fresh Tomato-Orange Chutney; and Risotto Cakes with Roasted Tomatoes and Foster&#x2019;s Arugula Pesto. Also featured are a host of wonderful desserts, such as Lemon Chess Pie with Sour Cherries and Chocolate Espresso Layer Cake with Mocha Latte Frosting.<br><br>Featuring mouthwatering favorites from the market and dozens of helpful sidebars that discuss ingredients, techniques, and make-ahead tips, The Foster&#x2019;s Market Cookbook provides all you need to know to make the most of every season&#x2019;s finest offerings.</p><p>Since 1990, Sara Foster has been delighting the patrons of her two North Carolina gourmet takeout food stores with refined yet unpretentious fare that reflects her Southern upbringing and years as a professional cook on the East Coast. <i>The Foster's Market Cookbook</i>, penned with food writer Sarah Belk King, collects dozens of Foster's most popular recipes, beloved for their use of high-quality seasonal ingredients and rich, imaginative flavor combinations. As with Ina Garten's <i>Barefoot Contessa Cookbook</i> and myriad tomes by Martha Stewart (for whom Foster worked in the 1980s), Foster's debut provides both advanced and fledgling home cooks with impeccably tasteful dinner-party menu ideas and creative weekday meals.<p> Starting the book as you might your morning, Foster offers tantalizing breakfast possibilities such as Sticky Orange-Coconut Pinwheels and traditional-with-a-twist brunch dishes such as Mushroom-Risotto Hash with Fried Eggs and Grilled Ham. Next come more than 15 soul-warming soups, stews, and chilies (Corn and Roasted Red Pepper Chowder is just one of many must-make entries); sandwiches and snacks; salads and sides; entrï¿½es; and desserts. Main-dish highlights include Chicken Breasts Stuffed with Prosciutto and Sun-Dried Tomatoes (they're so good and so easy to make!), Grilled Eggplant Parmesan with Fresh Mozzarella and Zesty Tomato Sauce, and Pan-Seared Sea Scallops with Tom Thumb Tomatoes and Foster's Pesto (a perfect quick spring meal). The desserts are divine, including chic confections such as Four-Layer Blueberry Gingerbread Cake with Mocha Cream, a collaboration with Durham pastry chef Kathy Edwards, as well as old-fashioned treats like strawberry shortcake and pecan pie (nicely jazzed with bourbon). Throughout, sidebars and tips on techniques give cooks additional opportunity to learn from Foster's fine food sensibility. For connoisseurs of simple yet sophisticated cuisine, <i>The Foster's Market Cookbook</i> truly titillates. <i>--Rebecca Robinson</i></p>From the Foreword by Martha Stewart<br><br>Sara has remained true to her beliefs and conviction that good, honest food can be deliciously simple.

I&#x2019;ve cooked many of the recipes collected for this book and eaten many more of Sara&#x2019;s creations, and I&#x2019;ve never been disappointed, only elated by the taste and appearance and freshness.<br><br>There are two busy, thriving, successful, and charming Foster&#x2019;s Markets, and they are popular not just as places to buy beautifully prepared, delicious foodstuffs, but also as relaxed, carefree gathering places where a cup of latte and a huge piece of crumb cake or a giant sticky bun or a bowl of steaming soup can be savored quietly with a book or a newspaper or with a group of friends.<br><br>Sara has prepared this cookbook with the same care and attention that she has lavished on the rest of her work. Well written and well tested, each recipe is sure to please. And the best news is that these represent just a small number of Sara&#x2019;s repertoire, so we can look forward to more of her collected recipes.</p><h2>Worlds Worst Children EXPORT</h2><p>From the world&#39;s favourite author, David Walliams - ten cautionary tales and a delightfully dreadful cast of characters; all in a gorgeously gifty FULL COLOUR format!

This beautifully conceived and thoroughly modern three-volume guide will appeal to the theological novice as well as to the ecclesiastical sophisticate. Making primary use of the Book of Common Prayer and the writings of the Church Fathers, <b>The Divine Hours</b> is also a companion to the New Jerusalem Bible, from which it draws its Scripture readings. The trilogy blends prayer and praise in a way that, while extraordinarily fresh, respects and builds upon the ancient wisdom of Christianity. <br><br>The second book in the set, Prayers for Autumn and Wintertime, provides prayers, psalms, and readings for these two festive seasons. Compact, with deluxe endpapers, it is perfect for those seeking greater spiritual depth. As a contemporary <b>Book of Hours</b>, <b>The Divine Hours: Prayers for Autumn and Wintertime</b> heralds a renewal of the tradition of disciplined daily prayer, and gives those already using the first volume the continuity they are seeking. The series will culminate in a third volume for springtime, completing the liturgical and calendar year with the offices for every day.</p><p><i>The Divine Hours: Prayers for Autumn and Wintertime</i> by Phyllis Tickle draws on the Book of Common Prayer and the Church Fathers, as well as the New Jerusalem Bible, to provide daily readings and prayers (for morning, noon, vespers, and complin) for every day between October and January. Tickle's book of hours modernizes the ancient practice of fixed-hour prayer, as originally practiced by the Jews ("Seven times a day do I praise you" [Psalm 119:164]) and adapted by early Christians. The book's introduction provides a short history of this tradition of prayer, whose centrality in Christian worship was cemented in the sixth century, when St. Benedict fashioned the rule of his community according to the schedule of fixed-hour prayer. The introduction also encourages readers to experiment with sung and chanted prayer (the encouragement includes the tantalizing observation by Saint Augustine that "Whoever sings, prays twice"). The discipline described by <i>The Divine Hours</i> is demanding, but the rewards, as Tickle describes them, are great. Christians who practice fixed-hour prayer "find themselves filled with a conscious awareness that they are handing their worship, at its final 'Amen,' on to other Christians in the next time zone. Like relay runners passing a lighted torch, those who do the work of fixed-hour prayer create thereby a continuous cascade of praise before the throne of God.""A welcome remedy for the increasing number of lay Christians who have rediscovered the daily offices...Tickle puts each day's prayers, psalms, readings, and refrains-everything you need-in one place...The rhythm that Tickle's book establishes gives one a stronger sense of participating in an ancient, worldwide but very personal liturgy."<br>-Nora Gallagher, beliefnet.com, and author of <b>Things Seen and Unseen: A Year Lived in Faith</b><br></p><h2>Golf Dreams: Writings on Golf</h2><p>rare and wonderful coming together of author and subject, Golf Dreams includes 30 pieces by bestselling author John Updike, culled from various sources--The New Yorker, Golf Digest, and his own fiction--which knowingly cover everything from the peculiar charms of bad golf to the camaraderie of good golf and the perils of its present boom.

Rounding out the collection of 30 pieces are excerpts from Updike's classic fiction, including <i>Three Rounds With Rabbit Angstrom</i>.I&#39;m not really a big fan of golf. In fact, I used to think it was less interesting than watching paint dry. But my father is an avid golfer, and recently a number of my friends have not only taken up the sport, but insist upon watching it on television. I am a big fan of John Updike, and thought, &#34;well, everybody can&#39;t be wrong&#34; in terms of golf, so I picked up the book. I was mesmerized.

Awakening only occasionally, he commands selected men to begin Burnings by giving them the ability to start fires coupled with consuming anger.<p> Whandall Placehold grows up in the stagnant, three-class society of Tep's town, part of a gang of thieves. No one gets in or out, since the town is hemmed in by a malevolent forest. But when Whandall is chosen by Yagen-Atep to start the Burnings, he resists the compulsion and, aided by Atlantean wizard Morth, escapes through the forest with a group of children he saves from certain death.</p><p> As the years pass, Whandall builds an empire, buys wagons and bison, and builds a trade route all along the California coast--except for Tep's Town. Life is good for Whandall and his bride, Willow, until they get a message from a desperate Morth: he convinces Whandall to return to Tep's Town and help eradicate, once and for all, an ancient magical being from Atlantis who has been trying to kill Morth for many years.</p><p> The Burning City is a lively book that deftly integrates social concerns of today with the magic and mythology of yesterday.

He looks peaked."<br>"You spoil him, Carrie. If he won't eat his dinner, don't let him go out and play. You were like that, you know."<br>"When I was his age, I was husky enough to cut down a tree with a hatchet. He couldn't cut his way out of a fog."<br>David would imagine himself invisible, floating unseen over their heads as they discussed him. Someone would ask if he had a girlfriend yet, and they would <i>tsk-tsk</i> whether the answer was yes or no. From his vantage point he would aim a ray gun at Uncle Clarence, whom he especially disliked, because he was fat, bald, and very rich. Uncle Clarence dipped his biscuits in his gravy, or in syrup, or more often in a mixture of sorghum and butter that he stirred together on his plate until it looked like baby shit.<br>"Is he still planning to be a biologist? He should go to med school and join Walt in his practice."<br>He would point his ray gun at Uncle Clarence and cut a neat plug out of his stomach and carefully ease it out, and Uncle Clarence would ooze from the opening and flow all over them.<br>"David." He started with alarm, then relaxed again. "David, why don't you go out and see what the other kids are up to?" His father's quiet voice, saying actually, That's enough of that. And they would turn their collective mind to one of the other offspring.<br>As David grew older, he learned the complex relationships that he merely accepted as a child. Uncles, aunts, cousins, second cousins, third cousins. And the honorary members--the brothers and sisters and parents of those who had married into the family. There were the Sumners and Wistons and O'Gradys and Heinemans and the Meyers and Capeks and Rizzos, all part of the same river that flowed through the fertile valley.<br>He remembered the holidays especially. The old Sumner house was rambling with many bedrooms upstairs and an attic that was wall-to-wall mattresses, pallets for the children, with an enormous fan in the west window. Someone was forever checking to make certain that they hadn't all suffocated in the attic. The older children were supposed to keep an eye on the younger ones, but what they did in fact was to frighten them night after night with ghost stories. Eventually the noise level would rise until adult intervention was demanded. Uncle Ron would clump up the stairs heavily and there would be a scurrying, with suppressed giggles and muffled screams, until everyone found a bed again, so that by the time he turned on the hall light that illuminated the attic dimly, all the children would seem to be sleeping. He would pause briefly in the doorway, then close the door, turn off the light, and tramp back down the stairs, apparently deaf to the renewed merriment behind him.<br>Whenever Aunt Claudia came up, it was like an apparition. One minute pillows would be flying, someone would be crying, someone else trying to read by flashlight, several of the boys playing cards by another flashlight, some of the girls huddled together whispering what had to be delicious secrets, judging by the way they blushed and looked desperate if an adult came upon them suddenly, and then the door would snap open, the light would fall on the disorder, and she would be standing there. Aunt Claudia was very tall and thin, her nose was too big, and she was tanned to a permanent old-leather color. She would stand there, immobile and terrible, and the children would creep back into bed without a sound. She would not move until everyone was back where he or she belonged, then she would close the door soundlessly. The silence would drag on and on. The ones nearest to the door would hold their breath, trying to hear breathing on the other side. Eventually someone would become brave enough to open the door a crack, and if she were truly gone, the party would resume.<br>The smells of holidays were fixed in David's memory. All the usual smells: fruit cakes and turkeys, the vinegar that went in the egg dyes, the greenery and the thick, creamy smoke of bayberry candles. But what he remembered most vividly was the smell of gunpowder that they all carried at the Fourth of July gathering. The smell that permeated their hair and clothes lasted on their hands for days and days. Their hands would be stained purple-black by berry picking, and the color and smell were one of the indelible images of his childhood. Mixed in with it was the smell of the sulfur that was dusted on them liberally to confound the chiggers.<br>If it hadn't been for Celia, his childhood would have been perfect. Celia was his cousin, his mother's sister's daughter. She was one year younger than David, and by far the prettiest of all his cousins. When they were very young they promised to marry one day, and when they grew older and it was made abundantly clear that no cousins might ever marry in that family, they became implacable enemies. He didn't know how they had been told. He was certain that no one ever put it in words, but they knew. When they could not avoid each other after that, they fought. She pushed him out of the hayloft and broke his arm when he was fifteen, and when he was sixteen they wrestled from the back door of the Winston farmhouse to the fence, fifty or sixty yards away. They tore the clothes off each other, and he was bleeding from her fingernails down his back, she from scraping her shoulder on a rock. Then somehow in their rolling and squirming frenzy, his cheek came down on her uncovered chest, and he stopped fighting. He suddenly became a melting, sobbing, incoherent idiot and she hit him on the head with a rock and ended the fight.<br>Up to that point the battle had been in almost total silence, broken only by gasps for breath and whispered language that would have shocked their parents. But when she hit him and he went limp, not unconscious, but dazed, uncaring, inert, she screamed, abandoning herself to terror and anguish. The family tumbled from the house as if they had been shaken out, and their first impression must have been that he had raped her. His father hustled him to the barn, presumably for a thrashing. But in the barn his father, belt in hand, looked at him with an expression that was furious, and strangely sympathetic. He didn't touch David, and only after he had turned and left did David realize that tears were still running down his face.<br>In the family there were farmers, a few lawyers, two doctors, insurance brokers and bankers and millers, hardware merchandisers, other shopkeepers. David's father owned a large department store that catered to the upper-middle-class clientele of the valley. The valley was rich, the farms in it large and lush. David always supposed that the family, except for a few ne'er-do-wells, was rather wealthy. Of all his relatives his favorite was his father's brother Walt. Dr. Walt, they all called him, never uncle. He played with the children and taught them grown-up things, like where to hit if you really meant it, where not to hit in a friendly scrap. He seemed to know when to stop treating them as children long before anyone else in the family did. Dr. Walt was the reason David had decided very early to become a scientist.<br>David was seventeen when he went to Harvard. His birthday was in September and he didn't go home for it. When he did return at Thanksgiving, and the clan had gathered, Grandfather Sumner poured the ritual before-dinner martinis and handed one to him. And Uncle Warner said to him, "What do you think we should do about Bobbie?"<br>He had arrived at that mysterious crossing that is never delineated clearly enough to see in advance. He sipped his martini, not liking it particularly, and knew that childhood had ended, and he felt a profound sadness and loneliness.<br>The Christmas that David was twenty-three seemed out of focus. The scenario was the same, the attic full of children, the food smells, the powdering of snow, none of that had changed, but he was seeing it from a new position and it was not the wonderland it had been. When his parents went home he stayed on at the Wiston farm for a day or two, waiting for Celia's arrival. She had missed the Christmas Day celebration, getting ready for her coming trip to Brazil, but she would be there, her mother had assured Grandmother Wiston, and David was waiting for her, not happily, not with any expectation of reward, but with a fury that grew and caused him to stalk the old house like a boy being punished for another's sin.<br>When she came home and he saw her standing with her mother and grandmother, his anger melted. It was like seeing Celia in a time distortion, as she was and would be, or had been. Her pale hair would not change much, but her bones would become more prominent and the almost emptiness of her face would have written on it a message of concern, of love, of giving, of being decisively herself, of a strength unsuspected in her frail body. Grandmother Wiston was a beautiful old lady, he thought in wonder, amazed that he never had seen her beauty before. Celia's mother was more beautiful than the girl. And he saw the resemblance to his own mother in the trio. Wordlessly, defeated, he turned and went to the rear of the house and put on one of his grandfather's heavy jackets because he didn't want to see her at all now and his own outdoor clothing was in the front hall closet too near where she was standing.<br>He walked a long time in the frosty afternoon, seeing very little, and shaking himself from time to time when he realized that the cold was entering his shoes or making his ears numb. He should turn back, he thought often, but he walked on. And he found that he was climbing the slope to the antique forest that his grandfather had taken him to once, a long time ago. He climbed and became warmer, and at dusk he was under the branches of the tiers of trees that had been there since the beginning of time. They or others that were identical to them. Waiting. Forever waiting for the day when they would start the whole climb up the evolutiona...</p><h2>Germinal (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Zola's masterpiece of working life, <em>Germinal</em> (1885), exposes the inhuman conditions of miners in northern France in the 1860s. By Zola's death in 1902 it had come to symbolize the call for freedom from oppression so forcefully that the crowd which gathered at his State funeral chanted "Germinal! Germinal!"<br> While it is a dramatic novel of working life and everyday relationships, <em>Germinal</em> is also a complex novel of ideas, given fresh vigor and power in this new translation.

Freya Stark had begun the extraordinary adventures that would glamorize her, though distinctly unglamorous, as the last of the great travelers. Hailed as a classic, the book chronicled her travels in remote and dangerous regions of the Middle East, inspiring Lawrence of Arabia to call the audacious, ambitious Freya "a gallant creature."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Her reputation had begun in 1927, when she was captured by French military police after penetrating their cordon around the rebellious Druze. She explored the mountainous territory of the mysterious Assassins of Persia, became the first woman to explore Luristan in western Iran, and followed the ancient frankincense routes to locate a lost city.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> At first a thorn in the side of the British colonial establishment for consorting with "wogs," Freya was later extravagantly admired by officialdom. Her knowledge of Middle Eastern languages and life aided the military and diplomatic corps, for whom she conceived an effective propaganda network during World War II.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Throughout her long life--she died in 1993, over a hundred years old, having been knighted at age eighty-two by the Queen--she rejoiced in the attentions of the press and of her audiences. In private she remarked that she put herself in harm's way in order not to fear death.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Her indomitable spirit was forged by contradictions. A child of privilege, she grew up in near poverty after her mother rashly allied herself with an Italian count in a rug manufacturing venture. She yearned for a formal education but was largely self-taught, mastering seven languages. She longed for love but consistently focused on the wrong men. She was thirty-four before she extricated herself from her family and embarked on the travels that would make her reputation. Her astonishing career lasted over sixty years, during which she produced twenty-two books unmatched for perception and poetic prose. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>This is a brilliant, balanced biography, rich in sheikhs, diplomats, nomad warriors and chieftains, generals, would-be lovers, and luminaries, with author Jane Fletcher Geniesse digging beneath the mythology to uncover a complex, quixotic, and controversial woman.</p><p>Never mind that upon her death in 1993, the then 100-year-old Dame Freya Stark rated a three-column obit in <i>The New York Times</i>. Mention her name to most Americans, and it will elicit a "Freya who?" The tales and travails of this romantic traveler, who marched alone into the Middle East from Persia to Yemen, discovering lost cities and creating an anti-Nazi intelligence system along the way, are captured in this compelling biography by former <i>New York Times</i> reporter Jane Fletcher Geniesse. <p> The author unveils not the fearless wanderer whose mappings and 30 books brought Stark awards from the likes of the Royal Geographical Society and made her a darling of British society. Instead Stark is seen as humble, insecure, and forever caught in the role of perpetual alien--be it when the English-born child grows up in Italy, where her mother lives in scandal, or when she plunges alone into the East, a feat never before accomplished by a Westerner.</p><p> An unwilling iconoclast whose love of travel, she would say, began as an infant when her father carried her in a basket over the Dolomites, Stark longed for the social security of the times: marriage and children. Proposals fell through, on occasion her beloved was married, or the romantic emotions she felt went unrequited--and besides, as a friend later pointed out, marriage would have spoiled her with its confinements. Rising above depression, self-imposed ostracism, and her numerous illnesses, Stark learned Arabic and how to climb mountains, map, partake in geographical digs, and find a niche in strange cultures.</p><p> Initially ridiculed for her passionate fondness of the Middle East, her writings ultimately generated vast interest for that mysterious part of the world, where she was surprisingly embraced, made privy to political movements closed to most foreigners, and even shown precious Islamic documents. At times a nurse, a war correspondent, a negotiator, Stark was a one-woman revolution of her time. Geniesse's intoxicating documentation of her life not only serves to stir up new interest in Stark's many books; it also ensures that the name Freya Stark will live on long after her obituary is but a scrap of yellowed, crackling newsprint. <i>--Melissa Rossi</i></p><br>"Passionate Nomad is a work of nonfiction that reads and sings with the drama and lilt of a fine novel. The story of Freya Stark is stunning, inspiring, sad, funny, unique, moving. Jane Fletcher Geniesse tells it straight but with a care for delicious detail and a sympathy for the characters that makes this truly a special book."<br>--Jim Lehrer<br><br>"Passionate Nomad is a thorough, vividly written account of one of the twentieth century's most intrepid travelers."<br>--Larry McMurtry<br><br>"Passionate Nomad is a lickety-split read, fun, fast-paced and exciting. . . . Only real life--and a remarkable biographer--could have fashioned a character as fascinating as Freya Stark." <br>--Peter Benchley<br><br>"A completely absorbing biography of this century's greatest travel writer. As well as exploring the life, times, and character of Freya Stark, Passionate Nomad brilliantly evokes the places she described and lived in--from Italy to the Middle East and beyond."<br>--Roderick MacLeish</p><h2>When I Was Old (Penguin Modern Classics)</h2><p><b><b>&#x201c;One of the greatest writers of the twentieth century . . .

Dreiser spins these scenes with the eye of a master in control of his form. <i>An American Tragedy</i> stands as an American masterpiece.<b>Theodore Dreiser</b> was born in Terre Haute, Indiana, on August 27, 1871. After a poor and difficult childhood, Dreiser broke into newspaper work in Chicago in 1892. A successful career as a magazine writer in New York during the late 1890s was followed by his first novel, <b>Sister Carrie</b> (1900). When this work made little impact, Dreiser published no fiction until <b>Jennie Gerhardt</b> in 1911. There then followed a decade and a half of major work in a number of literary forms, which was capped in 1925 by <b>An American Tragedy</b>, a novel that brought him universal acclaim. Dreiser was increasingly preoccupied by philosophical and political issues during the last two decades of his life.

Designed by Ferdinand Porsche and built by Volkswagen, the &#x2018;Kï¿½bel' was to the Germans what the Jeep was to the Allies and was used widely by the Wehrmacht and the Waffen-SS. When production ceased at the end of the war, 50,435 Kï¿½belwagen had been built. Of simple but sturdy construction, the VW Type 82 Kï¿½belwagen (which translates as 'bucket car' because of its similarity to a metal bathtub on wheels) was based closely on the legendary VW Beetle. Its winning design features included air cooled engine (the absence of a radiator meant the engine was less vulnerable to bullet damage), a light-weight, flat and smooth under-body that allowed the car to slide over the surface when its wheels were sinking into sand, mud or snow, independent suspension, portal gear hub reduction and self-locking differential. Because the body was not a load-bearing part of the structure of the vehicle it could easily be modified to special purposes. Several dozen variants of the 'Kï¿½bel' were developed and built during the war including its cousin the Schwimmwagen. The VW Type 128 and 166 Schwimmwagen (which means floating or swimming car) were amphibious four-wheel drive off-roaders. Like the Kï¿½bel, they were used widely by the Wehrmacht and the Waffen-SS during the Second World War. The Type 166 Schwimm is the most numerous mass-produced amphibious car in history (14,265 between 1942 and 1944). Erwin Komenda, Ferdinand Porsche's first car body designer, developed an all-new unitized body-tub structure for the Schwimmwagen swimming car. When crossing water a screw propeller could be lowered from the rear deck engine cover and coupled to the engine's crankshaft to provide drive. The &#x2018;Schwimm' also shared many of the Kï¿½bel's mechanicals. The appeal of the Kï¿½bel lived on long after the war's end when a derivative version, the Volkswagen Type 181, was manufactured by VW from 1968 to 1983. This was a two-wheel drive, four-door, convertible, off-road military vehicle, which had been developed for the German Army but was also sold to the civilian market as the Kurierwagen in Germany, the Trekker in the UK, the Thing in the US, and the Safari in Mexico. In recent years both the Kï¿½bel and Schwimm have acquired something of a cult status among military vehicle collectors worldwide, particularly in Europe (eg, Germany, Poland Czech Republic, Switzerland), the UK and US. There are literally dozens of Kï¿½belwagen and Schwimmwagen enthusiast/owner/interest groups! About 150 original Type 166 Schwimmwagens remain today.</p></p><p><p><b>Chris McNa</b>b&nbsp;specializes in military history and military technology.

The foremost Rebel spearhead on that second day of the battle was Barksdale&#x2019;s Mississippi brigade, which launched what one (Union) observer called the "grandest charge that was ever seen by mortal man.&#x201d;<br><br>Barksdale&#x2019;s brigade was already renowned in the Army of Northern Virginia for its stand-alone fights at Fredericksburg. On the second day of Gettysburg it was just champing at the bit to go in. The Federal left was not as vulnerable as Lee had envisioned, but had cooperated with Rebel wishes by extending its Third Corps into a salient. Hood&#x2019;s crack division was launched first, seizing Devil&#x2019;s Den, climbing Little Round Top, and hammering in the wheatfield.<br><br>Then Longstreet began to launch McLaws&#x2019; division, and finally gave Barksdale the go-ahead. The Mississippians, with their white-haired commander on horseback at their head, utterly crushed the peach orchard salient and continued marauding up to Cemetery Ridge. Hancock, Meade, and other Union generals desperately struggled to find units to stem the Rebel tide. One of Barksdale&#x2019;s regiments, the 21st Mississippi, veered off from the brigade in the chaos, rampaging across the field, overrunning Union battery after battery. The collapsing Federals had to gather men from four different corps to try to stem the onslaught.<br><br>Barksdale himself was killed at the apex of his advance.

Instead Chagnon discovered a remarkably violent society. Men who killed others had the most wives and offspring, their violence possibly giving them an evolutionary advantage. The prime reasons for violence, Chagnon found, were to avenge deaths and, if possible, abduct women. <br><br>When Chagnon began publishing his observations, some cultural anthropologists who could not accept an evolutionary basis for human behavior refused to believe them. Chagnon became perhaps the most famous American anthropologist since Margaret Mead&#x2014;and the most controversial. He was attacked in a scathing popular book, whose central allegation that he helped start a measles epidemic among the Yanomamï¿½ was quickly disproven, and the American Anthropological Association condemned him, only to rescind its condemnation after a vote by the membership. Throughout his career Chagnon insisted on an evidence-based scientific approach to anthropology, even as his professional association dithered over whether it really is a scientific organization. In <i>Noble Savages</i>, Chagnon describes his seminal fieldwork&#x2014;during which he lived among the Yanomamï¿½, was threatened by tyrannical headmen, and experienced an uncomfortably close encounter with a jaguar&#x2014;taking readers inside Yanomamï¿½ villages to glimpse the kind of life our distant ancestors may have lived thousands of years ago. And he forcefully indicts his discipline of cultural anthropology, accusing it of having traded its scientific mission for political activism. <br><br>This book, like Chagnon&#x2019;s research, raises fundamental questions about human nature itself.</p><p>Napoleon A. Chagnon is distinguished research professor at the University of Missouri and adjunct research scientist at the University of Michigan, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He formerly taught at the University of California-Santa Barbara, Penn State, Northwestern, and the University of Michigan. He is the author of five previous academic books and lives in Columbia, Missouri.Noble Savages 1<p></p> Culture Shock<p></p> My First Year in the Field<p></p> The First Day<p></p> <br>My first day in the field&#x2014;November 28, 1964&#x2014;was an experience I&#x2019;ll never forget. I had never seen so much green snot before then. Not many anthropologists spend their first day this way. If they did, there would be very few applicants to graduate programs in anthropology.<br> <br>I had traveled in a small aluminum rowboat propelled by a large outboard motor for two and a half days, cramped in with several extra fifty-five-gallon gasoline barrels and two Venezuelan functionaries who worked for the Malarialogï¿½a, the Venezuelan malaria control service. They were headed to their tiny outpost in Yanomamï¿½ territory&#x2014;two or three thatched huts. This boat trip took me from the territorial capital, Puerto Ayacucho, a small town on the Orinoco River, into Yanomamï¿½ country on the High Orinoco some 350 miles upstream. I was making a quick trip to have a look-see before I brought my main supplies and equipment for a seventeen-month study of the Yanomamï¿½ Indians, a Venezuelan tribe that was very poorly known in 1964. Most of their villages had no contact with the outside world and were considered to be &#x201c;wild&#x201d; Indians. I also wanted to see how things at the field site would be for my wife, Carlene, and two young children, Darius (three years old) and Lisa (eighteen months old).<br> <br>On the morning of the third day we reached a small mission settlement called Tama Tama, the field &#x201c;headquarters&#x201d; of a group of mostly American evangelical missionaries, the New Tribes Mission, who were working in two Yanomamï¿½ villages farther upstream and in several villages of the Carib-speaking Ye&#x2019;kwana, a different tribe located northwest of the Yanomamï¿½. The missionaries had come out of these remote Indian villages to hold a conference on the progress of their mission work and were conducting their meetings at Tama Tama when I arrived. Tama Tama was about a half day by motorized dugout canoe downstream from where the Yanomamï¿½ territory began.<br> <br>We picked up a passenger at Tama Tama, James P. Barker, the first outsider to make a sustained, permanent contact with the Venezuelan Yanomamï¿½ in 1950. He had just returned from a year&#x2019;s furlough in the United States, where I had briefly visited him in Chicago before we both left for Venezuela. As luck would have it, we both arrived in Venezuela at about the same time, and in Yanomamï¿½ territory the same week. He was a bit surprised to see me and happily agreed to accompany me to the village I had selected (with his advice) for my base of operations, Bisaasi-teri, and to introduce me to the Indians. I later learned that bisaasi was the name of the palm whose leaves were used in the large roofs of many Yanomamï¿½ villages: -teri is the Yanomamï¿½ word that means &#x201c;village.&#x201d; Bisaasi-teri was also his own home base, but he had not been there for over a year and did not plan to come back permanently for another three months. He therefore welcomed this unexpected opportunity to make a quick overnight visit before he returned permanently.<br> <br>Barker had been living with this particular Yanomamï¿½ group about four years at that time. Bisaasi-teri had divided into two villages when the village moved to the mouth of the Mavaca River, where it flows into the Orinoco from the south. One group was downstream and was called Lower Bisaasi-teri (koro-teri) and the other was upstream and called Upper Bisaasi-teri (ora-teri). Barker lived among the Upper Bisaasi-teri. His mud-and-thatch house was located next to their village.<br><br><br> <br>Left to right: James V. Neel, Napoleon Chagnon, and James P. Barker, 1966<br><br>We arrived at Upper Bisaasi-teri about 2 P.M. and docked the aluminum speedboat along the muddy riverbank at the terminus of the path used by the Indians to fetch their drinking water. The Yanomamï¿½ normally avoid large rivers like the Orinoco, but they moved there because Barker had persuaded them to. The settlement was called, in Spanish, by the men of the Malarialogï¿½a and the missionaries, Boca Mavaca&#x2014;the Mouth of the Mavaca. It sometimes appeared on Venezuelan maps of that era as Yababuji&#x2014;a Yanomamï¿½ word that translates as &#x201c;Gimme!&#x201d; This name was apparently&#x2014;and puckishly&#x2014;suggested to the mapmakers because it captured some essence of the place: &#x201c;Gimme&#x201d; was the most frequent phrase used by the Yanomamï¿½ when they greeted visitors to the area.<br> <br>My ears were ringing from three dawn-to-dusk days of the constant drone of the outboard motor. It was hot and muggy, and my clothing was soaked with perspiration, as it would be for the next seventeen months. Small biting gnats, bareto in the Yanomamï¿½ language, were out in astronomical numbers, for November was the beginning of the dry season and the dry season means lots of bareto. Clouds of them were so dense in some places that you had to be careful when you breathed lest you inhale some of them. My face and hands were swollen from their numerous stings.<br> <br>In just a few moments I was to meet my first Yanomamï¿½, my first &#x201c;primitive&#x201d; man. What would he be like? I had visions of proudly entering the village and seeing 125 &#x201c;social facts&#x201d; running about, altruistically calling each other kinship terms and sharing food, each courteously waiting to have me interview them and, perhaps, collect his genealogy.<br> <br>Would they like me? This was extremely important to me. I wanted them to be so fond of me that they would adopt me into their kinship system and way of life. During my anthropological training at the University of Michigan I learned that successful anthropologists always get adopted by their people. It was something very special. I had also learned during my seven years of anthropological training that the &#x201c;kinship system&#x201d; was equivalent to &#x201c;the whole society&#x201d; in primitive tribes and that it was a moral way of life. I was determined to earn my way into their moral system of kinship and become a member of their society&#x2014;to be accepted by them and adopted as one of them.<br> <br>The year of fieldwork ahead of me was what earned you your badge of authority as an anthropologist, a testimony to your otherworldly experience, your academic passport, your professional credentials. I was now standing at the very cusp of that profound, solemn transformation and I truly savored this moment.<br> <br>My heart began to pound as we approached the village and heard the buzz of activity within the circular compound. Barker commented that he was anxious to see if any changes had taken place while he was away, especially how many Yanomamï¿½ died during his absence. I found this somewhat macabre, but I later came to understand why this was an important concern: among the Yanomamï¿½ it is offensive&#x2014;and sometimes dangerous&#x2014;to say the name of a dead person in the presence of his close relatives, so it is important to know beforehand, if possible, who is no longer living to avoid asking about them.<br> <br>I nervously felt my back pocket to make sure that my nearly blank field notebook was still there, and I felt more secure when I touched it.<br> <br>The village looked like some large, nearly vertical wall of leaves from the outside. The Yanomamï¿½ call it a shabono. The several entrances were covered over with brush and dry palm leaves. Barker and I entered the opening that led to the river. I pushed the brush aside to expose the low opening into the village.<br> <br>The excitement of meeting my first Yanomamï¿½ was almost unbearable as I crouched and duck-waddled through the low passage into the open, wide village plaza. I looked up and gasped in shock when I saw a dozen burly, naked, sweaty, hideous men nervously staring at us down the shafts of their drawn arrows! Immense wads of green tobacco were stuck between their lower teeth and lips, making them look even more hideous. Strands of dark green snot dripped or hung from their nostrils&#x2014;strands so long that they drizzled from their chins down to their pectoral muscles and oozed lazily across their bellies, blending into their red paint and sweat.<br><br><br> <br>Green nasal mucus laden with hallucinogenic hisiomï¿½ snuff powder<br><br>We had arrived at the village while the men were blowing a greenish powder, a hallucinogenic drug called ebene, up each other&#x2019;s noses through yard-long hollow tubes. The Yanomamï¿½ blow it with such force that gobs of it spurt out of the opposite nostril of the person inhaling. One of the side effects of the hallucinogen is a profusely runny nose, hacking and choking, and sometimes vomiting. The nasal mucus is always saturated with the green powder, and the men usually let it run freely from their nostrils.<br> <br>My next discovery was that there were a dozen or so vicious, underfed growling dogs snapping at my legs, circling me as if I were to be their next meal. I stood there holding my notebook, helpless and pathetic. Then the stench of the decaying vegetation, dog feces, and garbage hit me and I almost got sick.<br> <br>I was shocked and horrified. What kind of welcome was this for the person who came here to live with you and learn your way of life, to become friends with you, to be adopted by you? The Yanomamï¿½ put their weapons down when they recognized and welcomed Barker and returned to their chanting, keeping a nervous eye on the village entrances.<br> <br>We had arrived just after a serious fight. Seven of the women from this shabono had been abducted the day before by a neighboring group, and the local men and their guests had just that morning recovered five of them in a brutal club fight that nearly ended in a shooting war with arrows. The neighboring abductors, now angry because they had just lost five of their seven new female captives, had threatened to raid the Bisaasi-teri and kill them with arrows. When Barker and I arrived and entered the village unexpectedly, they suspected or assumed that we were the raiders.<br> <br>On several occasions during the next two hours the men jumped to their feet, armed themselves, nocked their arrows, ran to the several entrances, and waited nervously for the noise outside the village to be identified. My enthusiasm for collecting ethnographic facts and esoteric kinship data diminished in proportion to the number of times such an alarm was raised. In fact, I was relieved when Barker suggested that we sleep across the river for the evening, adding &#x201c;because it would be safer over there.&#x201d; I disconsolately mumbled to myself, &#x201c;Christ! What have I gotten myself into here?&#x201d;<br> <br>As we walked down the path to the boat, I pondered the wisdom of having decided to spend a year and a half with these people before I had even seen what they were like. I am not ashamed to admit that had there been a diplomatic way out, I would have ended my fieldwork then and there. I did not look forward to the next day&#x2014;and months&#x2014;when I would be alone with these people. I did not speak a word of their language, and they spoke only their own language. Only a few of the young men knew a handful of words in Spanish&#x2014;not enough to utter even a short comprehensible sentence.<br> <br>The Yanomamï¿½ were decidedly different from what I had imagined them to be in my Rousseauian daydreams. The whole situation was depressing, and I wondered why, after entering college, I had ever decided to switch my major to anthropology from physics and engineering in the first place. I had not eaten all day, I was soaking wet from perspiration, the bareto were biting me, and I was covered with snot-laden red pigment, the result of a dozen or so complete examinations I had been given by as many very pushy, sweaty Yanomamï¿½ men.<br> <br>These examinations capped an otherwise grim and discouraging day. The naked men would blow their noses into their hands, flick as much of the green mucus off as they could in a snap of the wrist, wipe the residue into their hair, and then carefully examine my face, beard, arms, legs, hair, and the contents of my pockets. I asked Barker how to say, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do that. Your hands are dirty.&#x201d; My admonitions were met by the grinning Yanomamï¿½ in the following way: They would &#x201c;wash&#x201d; their hands by spitting a quantity of slimy tobacco juice into them, rub them together, wipe them into their hair, grin, and then proceed with the examination with &#x201c;clean&#x201d; hands.<br> <br>Barker and I crossed the river, carried our packs up the bank, and slung our hammocks in one of the thatched huts belonging to a Malarialogï¿½a employee. When Barker pulled his hammock out of a rubber bag, a heavy, damp, disagreeable odor of mildewed cotton and stale wood smoke wafted out with it. Even the missionaries are filthy, I thought to myself. But within two weeks, everything I owned smelled the same way, and I lived with that odor for the remainder of my fieldwork. My several field hammocks still smell faintly like that&#x2014;many years after my last trip to the Yanomamï¿½ and after many times through a washing machine.<br> <br>After I had adjusted to the circumstances, my own habits of personal cleanliness declined to such levels that I didn&#x2019;t protest anymore while being examined by the Yanomamï¿½, as I was not much cleaner than they were. I also realized that it is exceptionally difficult to blow your nose gracefully when you are stark naked and the invention of tissues and handkerchiefs is still millennia away.<br> <br>I was now facing the disappointing consequences of what, at the time, was a logical conclusion to a sequence of decisions I had made in college. When I had decided to study anthropology, I had to pick a specialization within it. I chose cultural anthropology. The next choice was to pick some kind of society&#x2014;tribesmen, peasants, or industrialized existing cultures. I picked unknown tribesmen, which limited the parts of the world I could study: there are no unknown tribesmen, for example, in the United States, so I would have to consider more remote places. One of the possible places was South America, and there most of the unknown tribesmen were in the Amazon Basin.<br> <br>So, here I was, my blank notebook in hand, preparing to dig in for seventeen more months of fieldwork. I was the proverbial blank slate incarnate.<br> My Life in the Jungle<p></p> <br>It isn&#x2019;t easy to plop down in the Amazon Basin for seventeen months and get immediately into the anthropological swing of things. You have been told or read about quicksand, horrible diseases, snakes, jaguars, vampire bats, electric eels, little spiny fish that will swim into your penis, and getting lost. Most of the dangers&#x2014;diseases, snakes, jaguars, spiny fish, eels, getting lost&#x2014;are indeed real, but your imagination makes them more ominous and threatening than many of them really are.<br> <br>Most normal people have no idea how many of the simple things in life just do not exist in the field&#x2014;something as simple as a flat surface to write on or put your coffee cup on. What my anthropology professors never bothered to tell me about was the mundane, unexciting, and trivial stuff&#x2014;like eating, defecating, sleeping, or keeping clean. This, I began to suspect, was because very few of my professors had done fieldwork in uncomfortable circumstances remotely similar to what I now faced. These circumstances turned out to be the bane of my existence during the first several months of field research. After that they became merely the unavoidable, inconvenient, but routine conditions of the life of a fieldworking anthropologist who unwittingly and somewhat naively decided to study the most remo...</p><h2>If I Ever Get Back to Georgia, I&#39;m Gonna Nail My Feet to the Ground</h2><p>"Lewis Grizzard is one of America's zaniest writers."<br>THE ORLANDO SENTINEL<br>Funny, sad, outrageous, irresistible, and unforgettably true, here is Lewis Grizzard's one-way, non-stop climb to the top of the newspaper heap. Of course, along the way, he drove a train and was a preacher, but the one and only life for this self-proclaimed Promising Young Man from Georgia was that of the ink-stained, stop-the-presses, honest-to-gosh newspaperman. This is his story.<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>This book chronicles Grizzard's ascension in the world of the daily newspaper to the highly coveted position of syndicated columnist. Getting his first newspaper job at age ten, he determinedly set out to rise through the ranks as a sportswriter, working for papers in Athens and Atlanta, Georgia, before taking a sports editor position in Chicago. After three years in Chicago, he landed his current job as a columnist for the Atlanta Constitution . Grizzard's voyage in the world of journalism exposed him to all kinds of adventure and eccentric personalities, and his descriptions are wildly amusing. When Grizzard touches on the more serious side of his personal life, his efforts are weaker and more superficial. On the whole, however, the book provides a comical and insightful look into the usually crazy world of the daily newspaper. A good choice for general and newspaper collections.

In this autobiography, written with PhillySport magazine editor Whitaker, he gives his side of the story. Raised in Pennsylvania and a star athlete in an integrated school, Allen was unlike most of the other black pioneers in his sport, who came from the segregated Deep South. He was sent to Little Rock, the first black player there, and was traumatized by the experience. When he got to the big leagues, he wanted to play his sport, not talk to newsmen, and so alienated them. But his talent was undeniable (he was voted the American League's most valuable player when he was with Chicago) and he left the game with considerable bitterness. The controversial Allen's viewpoint as presented is convincing, his memoir informative. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Knitting Architecture: 20 Patterns Exploring Form, Function, and Detail</h2><p><p>Explore the true foundations of knitting design: construction, form following function, stability, and ornamentation.</p><p>The parallels between knitting a sweater and constructing a building seem obvious when considered.

From the day I met her, she always has carried herself with a ballerina-like posture. If it&#x2019;s possible for a woman to be elegant at age eight, Amy was.<br><br>Amy arrived in our uncouth corner of Memphis in the middle of our third-grade year. She moved into the big brick house on Forrest Avenue with her mother and grandmother. Her mother had flawless creamy skin that made me want to touch her face and hands. Her grandmere spoke only French and wore an expensive perfume that, whenever I got close to her, came home with me in a pillowy after-cloud. At my house, I was the youngest of five and the only girl. Stepping into Amy&#x2019;s pink palace of femininity was my first brush with bliss.<br><br>The day Amy entered our class as the new girl, during roll call I studied her long raven tresses. How did she manage to balance her crisp white hair bow so perfectly on the back of her head?<br><br>At recess I followed her out to the playground. She turned around and, to my surprise, confided in me as if I were her best friend. &#x201c;My real name isn&#x2019;t Amy. It&#x2019;s Amelie Jeanette. Most people can&#x2019;t pronounce Amelie Jeanette the right way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I bet I can.&#x201d; The advantage of being the youngest with all those brothers was knowing how to accept every challenge and feign fearlessness. That is, until I got hurt. Then I would run away and hide.<br><br>Amy raised one of her Elizabeth Taylor eyebrows and waited for me to prove my stuff. I carefully repeated her first and middle names and then added her last name, &#x201c;DuPree,&#x201d; just to prove I&#x2019;d been paying attention in class. She was impressed.<br><br>I tested her back. &#x201c;Do you know my name?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course. It&#x2019;s Lisa Marie Kroeker.&#x201d;<br><br>She got my middle name wrong, but I didn&#x2019;t correct her. It was the spring of 1968, and everyone in Memphis, and maybe the rest of the world, had heard the name Lisa Marie that February when Elvis announced he and Priscilla had a baby girl. I liked being called Lisa Marie. Marie was much better than my real middle name, which I had never revealed to anyone.<br><br>For an entire week Amy and I were inseparable at school. She brought a package of Hostess Twinkies for lunch every day and always gave me the second one. When I was asked to choose a partner on my day as milk monitor, I chose Amy. It was the happiest stretch of my elementary career and a definite turning point in my no-frills childhood.<br><br>My reveling, however, took a nosedive at the end of our first week as best friends when Amy asked, &#x201c;Do you want to come to my house after school today and play Barbies?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Barbies?&#x201d; I repeated, feeling the walls of our brief Camelot crumble. My mother had unbendable views on Barbie dolls. She said Barbies were &#x201c;unrealistic&#x201d; in proportions, &#x201c;unsavory&#x201d; as role models, and an &#x201c;unnecessary&#x201d; waste of a young girl&#x2019;s leisure time. I rarely was allowed to play with other girls once my mother found out they owned Barbies. Girls who came to my house were expected to play hopscotch.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have any Barbies,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s okay; you can play with mine. I have eight,&#x201d; Amy said. &#x201c;And two Kens.&#x201d;<br><br>My stomach melted. <i>Eight </i>Barbies! <i>Two </i>Kens! <br><br>&#x201c;Amelie Jeanette.&#x201d; I tried to appeal to something deeper in her than even I understood. &#x201c;I have to tell you something.&#x201d;<br><br>This part of the story is where Amy shines best. She listened, eyes unblinking, as I explained my mother&#x2019;s ban on all things Barbie and her indictment against Ken dolls.<br><br>Amy slid her arm around my shoulder. &#x201c;Leave it to me, Lisa. Your mother will never know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But I will,&#x201d; I said, suffering from a strong sense of right and wrong. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll know about the Barbies at your house. And the Kens.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not if I never take them out of the closet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d;<br><br>With a flip of her ponytail she said, &#x201c;Whenever you come over, I&#x2019;ll leave them in the closet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Amy, are you saying you would give up Barbies for me?&#x201d;<br><br>She nodded.<br><br>I blinked almost as fast as a hummingbird&#x2019;s wings and told Amy I had something in my eye. I wasn&#x2019;t used to crying. But then, no other girl had ever been willing to give up Barbies for me.<br><br>True to her word, Amy never pulled her Barbies or her Kens out of the closet when I went over to her house. Not even once. I made it through childhood without defying my mother. I saved that delicacy for adulthood.<br><br>All Amy asked in return was for a few promises. Some of the promises were sweet, like agreeing to be each other&#x2019;s bridesmaid. Some were silly, like always reading the same Nancy Drew book at the same time and never reading a chapter ahead.<br><br>One promise was ridiculous, but I agreed to it anyway. Amy wanted us to go to Paris when we grew up. She said she wanted to stroll down some boulevard called the Champs-Elysï¿½es wearing high-heeled shoes and sunglasses. She said that would prove we were stylish. I could use all the style lessons I could get, so I willingly agreed to go with her.<br><br>That was before we had a falling out in high school and went our separate ways. We didn&#x2019;t talk to each other for eight years. Such a thing never should have happened to two friends such as we, but that&#x2019;s what happened.<br><br>During our separation I formed my own opinions of Amy&#x2019;s beloved France. I came to the conclusion that I never would go to Paris. Not even with Amy. Not even because I promised her I would.<br><br>However, I&#x2019;m beginning to believe that every promise can be heard in the celestial courts, which gives every promise the potential of becoming something of eternal significance. I don&#x2019;t know how it works. I don&#x2019;t know if God really was listening to the &#x201c;forever friends&#x201d; promises Amy and I made under the ruffles of her canopy bed when we were young. All I know is that Amy&#x2019;s and my childhood promises were unexpectedly called back into play on a rainy autumn afternoon in the emergency room of Cincinnati General Hospital.<br><br>It all started with a not-so-simple &#x201c;ooh la la!&#x201d;</p><h2>How Is It with Your Soul?</h2><p>This resource brings into balance the inner and outer dimensions of the Christian life.

Though born into poverty and on the streets by the age of fifteen, Daniel has overcome life's toughest obstacles and is now an associate at Reed, Briggs -- Portland's most prestigious law firm -- earning more money than he ever imagined possible.,/p&gt;</p><p>But when Aaron Flynn enters his life, Daniel finds himself caught between his towering ambition and his bedrock idealism. Flynn, a charismatic civil litigator, sues Geller Pharmaceuticals -- Reed, Briggs biggest client -- for manufacturing a drug that he claims causes unspeakable birth defects. Daniel is certain the claim has no merit -- until a memo written by a Geller scientist is found, detailing the shocking results of a study that implicates the company in a horrific lie.</p> <p>Could Daniel unwittingly be helping Geller cover up a dark secret? As he begins to investigate, his world comes tumbling down around him. His work is sabotaged, he's accused of professional incompetence, and he's fired. Twelve hours later the man who fired him is murdered. Daniel is arrested.</p><p>With help from two women, including lawyer Amanda Jaffe (whom we met in Wild Justice), Daniel scrambles to clear his name and save his reputation -- and in the process unearths a trail of deceit that leads back to a series of unsolved kidnappings seven years earlier. But someone doesn't want this trail explored, and Daniel becomes the target of a vicous killer who will stop at nothing to prevent the truth from being revealed.</p></p><p>Daniel Ames, a blue-collar associate at a preppy, white-shoe law firm, gets snookered by a pretty colleague into reviewing thousands of pages of documents. The client, a pharmaceutical company, is charged with falsifying test results on a new drug that appears to cause horrendous birth defects. Daniel is sure the company didn't do it, but among all the documents he overlooks a letter that could destroy his client's defense. The opposing counsel gets hold of it, and the next thing you know, Daniel's smack in the middle of a murder as well as the attendant legal fraud and chicanery. Who else, besides its manufacturer, wants the truth about the drug trials covered up? Whose body, charred almost beyond recognition, was found in the lab along with a score of dead test monkeys? And what's the connection between a double kidnapping and murder that happened years ago in Arizona and the headline-grabbing lawyer that's trying to pin the blame on Daniel's client for the drug's terrible effects?<p> Phillip Margolin, author of seven previous bestsellers (including <i>Wild Justice</i>), is clearly venturing into John Grisham territory here.

Most psychological explanations of human behavior are not only ludicrously inadequate oversimplifications, argues Dalrymple, they are socially harmful in that they allow those who believe in them to evade personal responsibility for their actions and to put the blame on a multitude of scapegoats: on their childhood, their genes, their neurochemistry, even on evolutionary pressures.<br><br>Dalrymple reveals how the fashionable schools of psychoanalysis, behaviorism, modern neuroscience, and evolutionary psychology all prevent the kind of honest self-examination that is necessary to the formation of human character. Instead, they promote self-obsession without self-examination, and the gross overuse of medicines that affect the mind.<br><br><i>Admirable Evasions</i> also considers metaphysical objections to the assumptions of psychology, and suggests that literature is a far more illuminating window into the human condition than psychology could ever hope to be.<br></p><p>Theodore Dalrymple is a retired physician and psychiatrist.

Alienated from family, home, language, and body, he exists in a state of mute acceptance, numb to the violence around him, till he is approached one morning by an old man who makes an unexpected proposal: that Dinesh marry his daughter, Ganga. Marriage, in this world, is an attempt at safety, like the beached fishing boat under which Dinesh huddles during the bombings. As a couple, they would be less likely to be conscripted to fight for the rebels, and less likely to be abused in the case of an army victory.

A gripping account that reads like a nonfiction <em>Cold Mountain, Sultana </em>is powerful, moving, rich in irony and fascinating historical detail&#x2014;a story no history aficionado or Civil War buff will want to miss.</p></p><p><p>A powerful account of a surprisingly forgotten tragedy of the Civil War </p><p>A stunning wartime account of human endurance and adventure, and an exploration of just how much the human body and mind can take, <em>Sultana</em> follows several young Union soldiers through the Civil War and what was, for them, its unimaginably disastrous aftermath. We see them enlist and then almost immediately be plunged into a cascading series of wartime horrors: Battle, trauma, prison camp, and, finally, the sinking of the <em>Sultana</em>, the steamboat that was taking them back home. </p><p>On an April night in 1865, the <em>Sultana</em> slowly moved up the dark Mississippi, its overtaxed engines straining under the weight of a human cargo that included an estimated twenty-four hundred passengers&#x2014;more than six times the number it was designed to carry. Most were weak, emaciated Union soldiers, recently paroled from Confederate prison camps, on their way home after enduring the violence of war. At two a.m., three of <em>Sultana</em>'s four boilers exploded. Within twenty minutes, it went down in fire and water, taking an estimated seventeen hundred lives. </p><p>The sinking of the <em>Sultana</em> remains the worst maritime disaster in American history, yet due to a confluence of contemporary events (Lincoln had recently been assassinated and the war had ended), it soon faded into relative obscurity. Now Alan Huffman presents this harrowing story against the backdrop of the endless suffering already endured by its survivors. Using contemporary research as well as digging deep into archives and family keepsakes, Huffman paints a gripping portrait of the young men who made it home alive. </p><p>A partner in the political research firm Huffman &amp; Rejebian, Alan Huffman has been a farmer; newspaper reporter; and aide to a Mississippi attorney general and a Mississippi governor. A contributor to the <em>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em>, the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Smithsonian</em> magazine and other publications, he is the author of <em>Ten Point</em>, <em>Mississippi in Africa</em> and <em>Sultana</em>. </p></p><h2>St. Paul: The Apostle We Love to Hate (Icons)</h2><p>St. Paul is known throughout the world as the first Christian writer, authoring fourteen of the twenty-seven books in the New Testament. But as Karen Armstrong demonstrates in <i>St. Paul: The Apostle We Love to Hate</i>, he also exerted a more significant influence on the spread of Christianity throughout the world than any other figure in history. It was Paul who established the first Christian churches in Europe and Asia in the first century, Paul who transformed a minor sect into the largest religion produced by Western civilization, and Paul who advanced the revolutionary idea that Christ could serve as a model for the possibility of transcendence. While we know little about some aspects of the life of St. Paul&#x2014;his upbringing, the details of his death&#x2014;his dramatic vision of God on the road to Damascus is one of the most powerful stories in the history of Christianity, and the life that followed forever changed the course of history.</p><p>Bestselling author Karen Armstrong is a distinguished writer noted for her memoirs and her books about religion. She majored in English at St. Anne&#x2019;s College in Oxford while living in a convent, an experience she wrote about in <i>Through the Narrow Gate</i>, which was published to laudatory reviews. She became an independent writer and has since published twenty-five books. In great demand as a public speaker, she is also the founder of the Charter for Compassion, which was funded with a TED grant.1<br> Damascus<br> &nbsp;<br> Luke&#x2019;s account of the descent of the Spirit on the Jewish festival of Pentecost may not be historically reliable but it certainly expresses the tumultuous character of the early Jesus movement. The twelve apostles and members of Jesus&#x2019;s family, he tells us, were at prayer in their Jerusalem lodging when they suddenly heard a roaring sound, like a driving wind; flames appeared and rested over the heads of each one of them. Filled with the Spirit, they began to speak in different languages and rushed outside to address a crowd of Jewish pilgrims who came from all over the diaspora, each one of whom heard them speaking in his native tongue. The apostles&#x2019; demeanor was so wild that some of the spectators thought they were drunk. Peter reassured them: These men, he explained, were simply filled with the Spirit of God. This was how the prophet Joel had described the Last Days, which had been set in motion by Jesus, a man revealed to Israel by miracles, portents, and signs. But, Peter told his large Jewish audience, by the &#x201c;deliberate will and plan of God he was given into your power, and you killed him, using heathen men to crucify him.&#x201d; Yet God had raised Jesus to a glorious life in the heavenly world, thus fulfilling David&#x2019;s prophecy in the psalm that begins: &#x201c;The Lord said to my Lord, &#x2018;Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool.&#x2019;?&#x201d; Israel must now acknowledge the crucified Jesus as Lord and Messiah; if people repented, were baptized, and separated themselves from &#x201c;this crooked age,&#x201d; they too would receive the Spirit and share Jesus&#x2019;s victory.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overnight Jesus, the man, had been forever transformed. After seeing him standing at God&#x2019;s right hand, his disciples had immediately begun to search the scriptures to help them understand what God had done for him. From a very early date they meditated on Psalm 110, which Peter quoted to the crowd. In ancient Israel, this had been sung during the coronation ceremony in the temple, when the newly anointed king, a descendant of David, had been elevated to near-divine status and made a member of the Divine Council of heavenly beings. Another psalm proclaimed that at his coronation the king had been adopted by Yahweh: &#x201c;You are my son, today I have become your father.&#x201d; The disciples also remembered that Jesus had sometimes spoken of himself as the &#x201c;son of man,&#x201d; a phrase that took them to Psalm 8, where the wonders of creation had inspired the psalmist to ask why God should have raised a lowly &#x201c;son of man&#x201d; to the eminence that, as they had seen with their own eyes, Jesus now enjoyed:<br><br> <i>You have made him little less than a god,</i><br> <i>You have crowned him with glory and splendour,</i><br> <i>Made him lord over the work of your hands,</i><br> <i>Set all things under his feet.</i><br><br> Again, the title &#x201c;son of man&#x201d; brought to mind the vision of the prophet Daniel, who had seen a mysterious figure &#x201c;like a son of man&#x201d; coming to the aid of Israel on the clouds of Heaven: &#x201c;On him was conferred sovereignty, glory, and kingship, and men of all peoples, languages, and nations became his servants.&#x201d; Jesus, the son of man, the disciples were now convinced, would soon return to rule the world and conquer Israel&#x2019;s oppressors. With truly remarkable speed, the titles &#x201c;lord&#x201d; (<i>kyrios</i> in Greek), &#x201c;son of man,&#x201d; and &#x201c;son of God&#x201d; were attributed to Jesus, the Messiah, the Christos, and used routinely by all New Testament authors.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Pentecost story suggests that the gospel had an immediate appeal for Greek-speaking Jews from the diaspora, many of whom joined the community of Jesus&#x2019;s followers. First-century Jerusalem was a cosmopolitan city. Devout Jews came from all over the world to worship in the temple, though they tended to form their own synagogues where they could pray in Greek rather than in Hebrew or the Aramaic dialect used in Judea. Some of them were dedicated to <i>ioudaismos, </i>a word that is often translated as &#x201c;Judaism&#x201d; or &#x201c;Jewishness&#x201d; but which during the Roman period had a more precise significance. The emperors respected the antiquity and morality of Israelite religion and had granted Jewish communities a degree of autonomy in the Greco-Roman cities. But this was often resented by local elites who were smarting under their own loss of independence, so periodically anti-Jewish tension erupted among the townsfolk. To counter this, some Greek-speaking Jews had developed a militant diaspora consciousness that they called <i>ioudaismos,</i> a defiant assertion of ancestral tradition combined with a determination to preserve a distinctly Jewish identity and forestall any political threat to their community&#x2014;even if they had to resort to violence. Some were even prepared to act as vigilantes to enforce the Torah and defend the honor of Israel. In Jerusalem, these more rigorous Jews were attracted to the Judean sect of the Pharisees, who were committed to a punctilious observance of the Torah. Because they wanted to live in the same way as the priests who served the Divine Presence in the temple, they laid special emphasis on the priestly purity laws and the dietary regulations that made Israel &#x201c;holy&#x201d; (<i>qaddosh</i> in Hebrew), that is, as &#x201c;separate&#x201d; and &#x201c;other,&#x201d; as God himself utterly distinct from the gentile world.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But other Greek-speaking Jews may have found life in the Holy City disappointing. In the diaspora, many had come to appreciate Hellenistic culture. They tended, therefore, to emphasize the universality inherent in Jewish monotheism, seeing the One God as the Father of all peoples, who was worshiped under different names. Some also believed that the Torah was not the possession of the Jews alone but that in their own way the ancestral laws of the Greeks and Romans also expressed the will of the One God. Instead of concentrating on ritual minutiae, therefore, these more liberal Jews were drawn to the ethical vision of the prophets, who had emphasized the importance of charity and philanthropy rather than the ceremonial laws of purity and diet. They probably found the Pharisees&#x2019; preoccupations stifling and petty, and they may also have been offended by the commercial exploitation of pilgrims in the Holy City. So when they heard the Twelve talking about Jesus, they would have been drawn to some of his teachings. For instance, he was said to have been critical of the Pharisees: &#x201c;You pay tithes of mint and rue and every garden herb but neglect justice and the love of God. It is these you should have practiced, without overlooking the other.&#x201d; They would also have liked the story of Jesus driving the money changers out of the temple as he quoted the words of Isaiah that reflected the universal implications of the cult: &#x201c;My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they joined the Jesus movement, these Greek-speaking Jews continued to pray in their own synagogues. But, Luke tells us, tension broke out between the Aramaic-speaking and Greek-speaking members. According to Acts, it began as a disagreement about the distribution of the food, which the Twelve solved by appointing seven Greek-speaking deacons to apportion rations to the community so that they themselves could devote more time to prayer and preaching. But Luke&#x2019;s account is full of contradictions, and it is clear that the duties of the seven deacons were not simply domestic One of them was Stephen, who was a charismatic preacher and miracle worker, while Philip, another of the Seven, led a mission to the non-Jewish regions of Samaria and Gaza. Reading between the lines of Luke&#x2019;s narrative, we can see that the Seven may have been leaders of a separate &#x201c;Hellene&#x201d; congregation in the Jesus movement who conducted their own preaching missions and were already reaching out to the gentile world.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Luke&#x2019;s story, this trivial dispute about food escalated with horrifying speed to a lynching in which Stephen was killed. Some of the diaspora Jews who were committed to <i>ioudaismos</i> were incensed by Stephen&#x2019;s liberal preaching and had him dragged before the high priest. At all costs, Stephen had to be stopped. &#x201c;This fellow is forever saying things against this holy place and against the law. For we have heard him say this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy [the temple] and alter the customs handed down to us by Moses.&#x201d; Luke claims that these were trumped-up charges put forward by false witnesses; yet he makes Stephen give a long speech that does conclude with a defiant rejection of the temple cult. This, as we have seen, was indeed a bone of contention. Stephen&#x2019;s views were shared in part by the Qumran sectarians and by the peasants who refused to pay their tithes. According to the gospels, Jesus also predicted the temple&#x2019;s destruction. When Stephen finally cried, &#x201c;Look! I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God,&#x201d; his accusers were filled with rage and, flinging their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul, they hustled Stephen out of the city to stone him. &#x201c;Saul,&#x201d; Luke ends this tragic tale, &#x201c;was among those who approved of this execution.&#x201d;</p><h2>All Shot Up</h2><p>Coffin Ed Johnson and Grave Digger Jones, two Black police detectives, investigate when a staged hit-and-run is followed by a deliberate hit-and-run, and blackmail</p><p>Chester Himes was born in Jefferson City, Missouri in 1909 and grew up in Cleveland.Aged 19 he was arrested for armed robbery and sentenced to 20 to 25 years in jail.

Ther private lives are now the stuff of soap opera and it seems any one who comes into contact with them sells their story to the magazines or to the newspapers. Marion Crawford, &#39;Crawfie&#39;, as she was known to the Queen and Princess Margaret, became governess to the children of the Duke and Duchess of York in the early 1930s, little suspecting she was nurturing her future Queen. Beginning at the quiet family home in Piccadilly in the early 1930s and ending with the birth of Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace in 1948, Crawfie tells how she brought the princesses up to be &#39;Royal&#39; whilst also exposing them to the ordinary world of underground trains, buses and swimming lessons. Her anecdotes, accompanied by over a hundred photographs, provide a fascinating insight into the childhood of Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret. THE LITTLE PRINCESSES was published in 1950 to a furore we cannot imagine today. It was the first account of life with the Royals ever published and, although it is a touching account of the childhood of the Queen and Princess Margaret, Crawfie was demonised by the press and the Queen Mother, who had been a great friend and who had, Crawfie maintained, given her permission to write the account never spoke to her again.</p><p>Marion Crawford - see above Jennie Bond has been Royal Correspondent for the BBC for the past 12 years during which time she has covered the most eventful period in the history of the Royal Family, including three divorces and Lady Diana&#39;s death.An utterly charming depiction of a wholsome childhood in a loving family. * THE WEEK *</p><h2>Beyond the River (The Young Underground #2)</h2><p>While visiting their cousins&#39; farm on the west coast of Denmark in the summer of 1944, eleven-year-old twins Peter and Elise learn the power of prayer as they work to rescue a downed British pilot.</p><p><b>Robert Elmer</b> is a graduate of St. Mary's College and Simpson College in San Francisco.

It was 1914, a few days before Christmas. The German army had just finished an artillery barrage. Domagk's unit had been sent in, the young men and their officers walking slowly through the yellowing grass toward a Polish farmhouse, their breath showing white, when shots came from somewhere to their left. Domagk saw the officer nearest him fall. Then he felt a blow to his head. His helmet flew off and landed somewhere in the grass. His chest felt hot. When he looked down, he saw the blood. He had attended a single term of medical school before joining the army and knew enough to give himself a quick exam. He found no wound on his body. Then he discovered the source. Blood was streaming from his head, down his neck, and onto his shirt. He explored his scalp gently with his fingers. Hard to say how bad the gash was, but it had probably opened when the bullet knocked his helmet off. He bandaged himself with a large handkerchief. Then he passed out. When he awoke, he was jolting through trees in a farmer's cart toward what had been a church, now a German field hospital, where he was examined, his bleeding stopped, and his wound dressed. When the staff decided that it appeared likely he would survive, he was packed onto a train to Berlin, to recuperate in a central hospital. The wound did not look serious, but there was no way to know if there would be permanent brain damage. Time would tell.<br><br> The blow to his head did not change Domagk's mind about the war. He, like most of his fellow university students, had been infected and rendered mildly delirious during the epidemic of patriotic fever that swept Germany in the summer of 1914. The tall, thin boy volunteered for service with more than a dozen of his classmates and friends soon after war was declared. They were inducted as a group into the Leibgrenadier Regiment of Frankfort on the Oder, a unit specializing in the use of grenades. They were given a few weeks of cursory training. Then they were loaded onto a train for Flanders.<br><br> They were young and full of energy, eager to join Germany's march, giddy with visions of a short, glorious war. Domagk, the son of a village schoolmaster, was eighteen years old and ready for adventure. He was also a young gentleman who brought his lute to training camp and played folk tunes around the campfire. He wanted to take the instrument with him to the front. When his officers told him that regulations forbade it, he dismantled it, sent the body back to his parents, and kept the neck attached to his knapsack as a memento. Inside the knapsack he carried a photo of his village sweetheart dressed in her white Communion gown.<br><br> Now, months later, he was beginning to miss his home, Lagow in the lake country of far eastern Germany. Picturesque and quiet, Lagow became the source of ever-sunnier memories the longer he spent in the army: cannonballing into the river below the mill; a swarm of children flying out of school at the end of the day; a group of friends concocting homemade gunpowder; sneaking his first cigar; the taste of a ripe pear in late summer. He spent his nineteenth birthday in the trenches of Flanders under fire from British ships, huddled in the dirt, "the heavens lit," he wrote his parents, "from burning villages." The glory of war began to fade. He and his comrades were soaked by freezing autumn rains, exhausted, starving, their uniforms caked with muck. Once while digging for drinking water, they broke open an abscess in the earth, a cache of rotting French soldiers, men killed and buried, he figured, by his own unit's grenades.<br><br> The Germans were dug in near the Belgian coastal town of Nieuport, where in late October the Leibgrenadier Regiment of Frankfort on the Oder was ordered to participate in a massive attack. Their officers told them that following a 4:00 a.m. German artillery barrage they would charge forward from their trenches and drive the enemy from their trenches. The young men synchronized their watches. They wrote last letters home and put them in their pockets, promising each other that the living would deliver them for the dead. They waited for what seemed a very long time in the dark, listening to shells screaming overhead, watching the flashes.<br><br> When the barrage stopped, the young German soldiers struggled and slipped out of their holes. They slogged through a football field's length of mud before they started falling, then heard the chattering of machine guns at short range, each one firing as many bullets as 250 rifle-equipped soldiers. Most of the boys Domagk had joined with were dead within a few seconds. The rest ran. Domagk later figured that only he and two or three others out of his group of fifteen student volunteers survived the battle alive and unwounded. They learned later that their charge was part of a huge failed offensive in which the Germans lost 135,000 soldiers, many of them recent university students, in the course of four weeks of fierce fighting. The British called it the First Battle of Ypres. The Germans called it Kindermord: "The Massacre of the Innocents."<br><br> Too ripped up to fight any longer in Flanders, Domagk and what remained of the Leibgrenadiers were transferred to the Eastern Front. A few weeks later, he lost his helmet near the Polish farmhouse. When he began to gather his senses about him in a Berlin hospital room, he discovered that his knapsack was gone, along with the neck of his lute and the photo of his sweetheart. All he now had of his childhood were memories. He remembered his father sitting at the window, waiting for the lamp man. The gas streetlights in Lagow were lit every evening by the lamp man, who came came by with his white horse. Then one day the man stopped coming. When Gerhard's father explained to him that the lamp man had been delayed because his horse was sick, the young boy was stricken by the idea. "I said at the end of the evening prayer with my mother, 'Good God, please make the lamp man come again,'" he remembered. "'Make his horse better again.' "<br><br> The German army hospital administration in Berlin, on reviewing their records, found that wounded Leibgrenadier Gerhard Domagk had attended a bit of medical school. It was decided that rather than send him back to the front lines, they would set him to the task of providing medical care for the wounded. Domagk was placed in a training program for medical assistants, one of hundreds of novices hastily pressed into service. After a few weeks of first-aid training, he was sent back to the Eastern Front, through Krakow to a field hospital in the Ukraine. He was fascinated by his trip through "the culture of the East," as he called it, the lands of Germany's destiny, the "beautiful but dirty streets," the Jews with "caftans reaching over their long boots and their corkscrew-like curls hanging down from their temples." He was especially impressed by the architecture he saw.<br><br> Flanders had been bad, but the Eastern Front was in many ways worse, especially when it came to medical care. The German casualties were just as heavy, but the hospitals were cruder, doctors fewer, supplies scarcer. The field hospital to which Domagk was assigned was stark, a farm in the middle of the woods roughly converted into a care facility with tents for wards and a barn for an operating room. Every day a miscellany of ambulances, cars, trucks, and farm carts arrived, disgorged their loads of quiet, white-faced wounded, and left for more. There was a constant, deep rumble from big guns a few miles away.<br><br> They were seeing wounds no one had ever seen before, thanks to the advance of military and industrial science. Newly deployed and unprecedentedly powerful weapons--artillery that could shoot shells 120 kilometers, high-explosive shells like the giant "Jack Johnsons" that geysered black earth a hundred feet in the air, airplanes and aerial bombs, tanks and poison gas--were slaughtering men at a rate and in ways unimaginable a few years earlier. In previous wars men had been shot or stabbed. Now they were blown to bits. The new weapons changed both the manner of fighting--more trenches, fewer cavalry charges--and what happened after. Because of the new weapons, the number of dead and wounded on both sides was staggering. During the entire Franco-Prussian War in the 1870s, a total of a quarter of a million men were killed and wounded on both sides over ten months of battle--roughly the same total number of killed and wounded at the First Battle of Ypres alone. Military leaders realized within a few months of the war's start that they needed to quickly expand their medical services. Anyone with any medical ability was pressed into service in the rapidly growing network of hospitals. That was how Domagk ended up in the woods of the Ukraine.<br><br> One of his jobs was to sort the new arrivals, separating the obvious infectious cases, cholera especially, and moving them out of camp as quickly as possible; setting aside those whose wounds were least severe, those with the best chance of recovery, and sending them immediately into the queue for surgery; then arranging for the remainder, the severely wounded, those with parts of their heads blown away, the cases with burst intestines, those no longer responsive. The worst were put under the straw. Comforted as much as possible, of course, given water, told their turn would come, to keep up their spirits, that the straw would keep them warm. They were generally in shock anyway, pulses thready, color graying, skin growing cold. They would last a night or two at most. Another of his jobs was to go out in the morning, pull the straw away, and make a final sorting. The living were reexamined.

Since then, Ballard has retained a deep emotional connection to <i>Titanic</i>. "The ship wouldn't change much in my lifetime," he says, "if left unmolested by treasure hunters." But "salvagers, pirates, filmmakers, [and] thrill-seekers" have, in his view, raped a cherished monument, a view that has faced fierce opposition by many. With co-writer Sweeney, Ballard thoroughly reviews <i>Titanic</i>'s history and the catastrophic events that led to her demise. He describes his dream of turning the ship into a museum on the ocean floor, easily explored from above by computer. As he discusses his 2004 return voyage to the wreck, Ballard will hold <i>Titanic</i>-philes riveted by the human and scientific elements of the tragedy. He gives specific detail, writing, "[the] mast from which the lookouts issued warnings had collapsed into the well deck." Although the text recycles much familiar material, it's Ballard's passion and expertise that make this book tick. The book's most unique contributions are the numerous photos of those who have died while analyzing and photographing the wreckage, and the pictures of the intricate equipment used to accomplish the monumental task of undersea exploration.

About 6,000 artifacts have been removed from the vessel and the water around it since Ballard discovered the ship 13,000 feet below the surface in 1985. In May 2003 Ballard returned to document the damage done to the ship since then. "Ensuring <i>Titanic</i>'s preservation was at the heart of the expedition," he writes. Ballard wants to give the vessel the same kind of protection "that has shielded other national and international treasures." He tells how his team discovered the ship and how they returned a year later to explore the wreckage in a three-man submersible. He chronicles their return in May, documenting the damage and decay that has occurred. Additionally, Ballard recounts the ship's history, describing in moving detail the night it went down.

Mr. Winters, the security mogul who won it, offers a proposition she can't refuse: to test the new security robots on his train. He is willing to pay. In a fit of recklessness, Daisy takes the job. Kibuishi's art and storytelling in his Wild West confection convey a sense that Daisy's world isn't created as much as spontaneously unfolding as you read. His art is a hybrid of the best aspects of both <i>manga</i> and American animation yet is more unique than that suggests. It expresses Daisy's restrained frustration and Tom's aw-shucks likability and also the wide-open space of the Wild West. <i>Tina Coleman</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Here, women live within stringently enforced doctrines of wifely submission and male headship, and live by the Quiverfull philosophy of letting God give them as many children as possible so as to win the religion and culture wars through demographic means.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p><b>Kathryn Joyce </b>is a freelance journalist whose writing has appeared on Salon and in the <i>Nation, Mother Jones, Newsweek, Double X, </i>and other publications. She lives in New York City.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i><b>From chapter two, "The Church Comes Home"</b><br><br>Conservative Christians may say they have no use for feminism, but inï¿½creasingly, over the past twenty years, feminism&#x2014;that is, sworn enmity to it&#x2014;has become a rallying point for conservative and orthodox believers ranging from evangelicals to Catholics to Mormons to Reformed Protï¿½estants to fundamentalists, almost a stronger organizing principle than particular doctrines themselves. Feminism, as they see it, is what started it all. Mary Pride, an early leader in the homeschool movement and publisher of the influential <i>Practical Homeschooling </i>magazine, was also author of <i>The Way Home: Beyond Feminism, Back to Reality, </i>a book published in 1985 that did much to recreate the homeschooling movement along patriarchal and militantly fertile lines. Pride sees feminism as combining a range of ills from communism to self-worship to witchcraft. The influence of femiï¿½nists, she writes, can be seen in the &#x201c;victimization&#x201d; of women through no-fault divorce laws; in casual sex, which lowers women from protected wives to the level of &#x201c;unpaid prostitutes&#x201d;; in vice peddling, such as cigaï¿½rette and alcohol companies &#x201c;cashing in&#x201d; on displaced homemakers whose husbands have left them; and in lower wages for husbands with the abolï¿½ishment of the gender-weighted &#x201c;family wage&#x201d; (paying men more than women on the argument that they were working to support dependents, while women were working for &#x201c;extra&#x201d; income). Not to mention what Pride sees as the cause-and-effect slide from socially sanctioned birth control to legalized abortion. <br><br>But the most troubling aspect of feminism to Pride, along with a wide-ranging band of fellow believers, whether they call themselves paï¿½triarchalists, antifeminists, complementarians (as opposed to egalitarians, feminism&#x2019;s mild evangelical cousins), or proponents of biblical manhood and womanhood, isn&#x2019;t any of its specific sins, but its acceptance by Chrisï¿½tians, allowing the philosophy of the enemy to strike at Christ&#x2019;s church. <br><br>&#x201c;Christians have accepted feminists&#x2019; moderate demands for family planning and careers while rejecting the radical side of feminism&#x2014;meanï¿½ing lesbianism and abortion,&#x201d; she writes. &#x201c;What most do not see is that one demand leads to the other. Feminism is a totally self-consistent sysï¿½tem aimed at rejecting God&#x2019;s role for women. Those who adopt any part of its lifestyle can&#x2019;t help picking up its philosophy. And those who pick up its philosophy are buying themselves a one-way ticket to social anarchy.&#x201d; Pride isn&#x2019;t suggesting some easy reversion to the Ozzie and Harriet model of the 1950s, but something more extreme. &#x201c;Feminism is self-consistent. The Christianity of the fifties wasn&#x2019;t. Feminists had a plan for women. Christians didn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; <br><br>But since, and in large part due to, Pride&#x2019;s writing, Christians do have a plan: a &#x201c;whole-cloth,&#x201d; integrated lifestyle for women. It is not about independence and self-fulfillment but submissive wives following the leadership of patriarch husbands, working at home to educate their children and support their husband through his work, rest, and minisï¿½try, and &#x201c;dying to the self &#x201d;&#x2014;a Christ-like self-abnegation and acceptance of God&#x2019;s plan for their role in life as helpmeets to their husbands. This biblical womanhood, encompassing homework, motherhood, and wifeï¿½hood as they were lived not in the 1950s but in a notion of preindustrial, pre&#x2013;household appliance times, is what Pride calls a &#x201c;total lifestyle&#x201d;&#x2014;as comprehensive as the pervasive influence of feminism, which has reached every part of women&#x2019;s work lives, biology, and thinking. And this time around, the antifeminists intend to be fiercely diligent&#x2014;rooting out the worldly, &#x201c;feministic&#x201d; ideas and influences in their churches, entertainï¿½ment, and own thinking and making sure it doesn&#x2019;t come back. <br><br>In a way, to that minority of American women who actually do claim the title &#x201c;feminist&#x201d;&#x2014;a rarity bemoaned by both feminists and antifemiï¿½nists alike, who both see the majority of women living out feminist ideals without recognizing or acknowledging their roots in the women&#x2019;s libï¿½eration movement&#x2014;this heated attention and estimation of feminist power is strangely flattering. Nobody has taken the feminist threat to decency and order this seriously since the 1970s. But it&#x2019;s less amusing to realize that the movement against feminism, including all its unacï¿½knowledged aspects, such as the acceptance of women&#x2019;s careers, the expectation of pay equity, a greater degree of sexual freedom and bodily self-determination, more equitable divisions of housework and childï¿½care, and shared decision-making between husbands and wives, is being undertaken on a large scale by a coalition that goes far beyond the home-schooling community with its separatist ethos, yet which has echoed the ideas of men and women as extreme as Doug Phillips and Mary Pride with surprising fidelity. <br><br>John Piper and Wayne Grudem, both Reformed Baptist preachers and theologians, are leading members of the Council on Biblical Manï¿½hood and Womanhood (CBMW), an organization founded in 1987 with the goal of fighting feminist or egalitarian influences in the evangelï¿½ical church. Piper and Grudem targeted the modest trend of &#x201c;Christian feminism,&#x201d; a gentler notion of equality than mainstream feminism that was sparked in part by moderate theologians questioning the long-held assumptions of evangelical churches that women should be barred from positions of church authority or, in some denominations, from speakï¿½ing in church at all. Christian egalitarians also believe that the church shouldn&#x2019;t discourage women&#x2019;s careers outside the home and that family planning decisions are best left within the family. <br><br>But even such tepid endorsements of gender equality were threatï¿½ening to established patriarchal traditions, and the CBMW was formed as a rebuttal. The Council, which today spreads its message through the sixteen-million-member Southern Baptist Convention, the conservative Presbyterian Church in America, and the evangelical ministry Campus Crusade for Christ, grew out of the publication of the &#x201c;Danvers Stateï¿½ment,&#x201d; an antiegalitarian document signed by dozens of theologians and pastors whose names have become synonymous within evangelical cirï¿½cles with Christian antifeminist activism. They include Beverly LaHaye, founder of Concerned Women for America and wife of <i>Left Behind </i>auï¿½thor Tim LaHaye; Dorothy Patterson, wife of Paige Patterson, one of the architects of the conservative takeover of the Southern Baptist Convenï¿½tion; Mary Kassian, a leading writer and conference speaker on biblical womanhood; CBMW board members Pat Robertson and Paige Patterï¿½son; and a number of men pushing the evangelical church toward Reï¿½formed theology, more commonly known as Calvinism or Puritanism: John MacArthur, Jr., R.C. Sproul, Sr., D.A. Carson, and dozens of othï¿½ers. Heavyweight contenders in the theological-political realm have also contributed essays and support to the CBMW, such as Albert Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, which steers the doctrine of the mammoth denomination. In an essay for CBMW, Mohler called for courageous action in reestablishing traditional gender roles throughout American Christendom. And Piper today disseminates his complementarian theology through his popular &#x201c;Desiring God&#x201d; minï¿½istry, church &#x201c;plants&#x201d; (expanding a network of churches like a franchise from his own Minnesota-based church), and conference series. <br><br>The Danvers Statement, which stands as the Council&#x2019;s call to arms, holds that &#x201c;widespread uncertainty and confusion in our culture regardï¿½ing the complementary differences between masculinity and femininity,&#x201d; the promotion of feminist egalitarianism, ambivalence toward motherï¿½hood and homemaking, calls for female church leadership, and &#x201c;growï¿½ing claims of legitimacy&#x201d; for &#x201c;illicit&#x201d; sexual relationships&#x2014;that is, gay rights&#x2014;had all jeopardized the authority of Scripture, making theology too confusing for &#x201c;ordinary people&#x201d; who depend on the Bible&#x2019;s literalï¿½ism for direction. Such laity, the Council warned, would be thrown into uncertainty, and perhaps doubt, by an &#x201c;evolved&#x201d; standard on gender that seemed to contradict the given Word: if God&#x2019;s revelations on the sexes were up for modernization, why not the rest? And the careless threat to the faith, they argued, was all in the name of the church accommodating the world rather than seeking to shape that world to the standards of the gospel. <br><br>The founding purpose of the Council was, in short, to counteract these influences by promoting a biblical view of the relationship between men and women, at home and in the church, through academic and popï¿½ular publications. They sought to encourage lay people to study Scripï¿½ture as a literal guide for biblical gender roles and relations and apply these guidelines to their lives, and thereby heal &#x201c;people and relationships injured by an inadequate grasp of God&#x2019;s will concerning manhood and womanhood; to help both men and women realize their full ministry potential through a true understanding and practice of their God-given roles, and to promote the spread of the gospel among all peoples by fosï¿½tering a biblical wholeness in relationships that will attract a fractured world.&#x201d; <br><br>In other words, the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood sought to make marriages that look like a return to well-ordered harmony an advertisement for the church. In a world grappling with the growï¿½ing pains of new demands for marital fair play and with...</p><h2>Pokï¿½mon X &amp; Pokï¿½mon Y: The Official Kalos Region Guidebook: The Official Pokï¿½mon Strategy Guide</h2><p>Here&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;ll find inside:<br> <br> ï¿½ Trade paperback edition of the popular selling <i>Pokï¿½mon X &amp; Pokï¿½mon Y: The Official Kalos Region Guidebook</i> hardcover!<br> <br> ï¿½ A complete walkthrough of all the Gym Badges!<br> <br> ï¿½ Detailed information on all the new game features, from Sky Battles and Horde Encounters to Pokï¿½mon-Amie and more!<br> <br> ï¿½ A guide to where to find hidden items and special Pokï¿½mon&#x2014;with a location index!<br> <br> ï¿½ Hints on the best ways to use Roller Skates, ride Pokï¿½mon, and challenge Gym Leaders!<br> <br> ï¿½ Helpful tips and tricks for getting the most out of the PSS and online play!<br> <br> ï¿½ An updated type matchup chart that includes the all-new Fairy type!<br> <br> ï¿½ Pullout map to guide you through the Kalos region!</p><p>The <b>Pokï¿½mon Company International</b> is a subsidiary of the Pokï¿½mon Company in Japan, and is responsible for managing the property outside of Asia.&nbsp;Since its creation in Japan in 1996, Pokï¿½mon has been one of the most popular entertainment brands in the world.

For both homeowners and professionals, he shows how to design, size, and install pipes using a variety of standard materials and tools.</p><p>Hemp is a residential plumber with 22 years experience.This is more for people building a house than those remodeling one, but its no-nonsense, in-depth explanations and marvelously clear illustrations make it a worthwhile reference for anyone facing an expedition into the crazy world of domestic plumbing. Like any really good book, it broaches some controversy: Hemp apparently doesn't go along with the idea that fluoridated water is likely to bond with elements of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes and pose a health risk. But he isn't going to tell you what to do, merely how to do whatever it is you want to do. He mentions the controversy, but he describes in some detail several kinds of pipes for every application. Showing keen appreciation of where real power in the construction universe lies, he notes that local governing bodies are the ultimate arbiters of plumbing morality, so check with them before proceeding. Creating your own plumbing system is a daunting task. Those who are game will want to have Hemp, or at least his book, at their side. <i>Mike Tribby</i></p><h2>How to Read the Aura, Practice Psychometry, Telepathy and Clairvoyance</h2><p>Renowned parapsychologist W.

Adler (The Four Dimensions of Philosophy, 1993, etc.) argues against his own earlier work in saying that painting and music do not belong in the core of instructional materials. Rather, he argues, they belong to the realm of appreciation and delight. Through careful definitions of terms such as art, the arts, and ideas, the author seeks to demonstrate that the great ideas embodied in written literature, ideas that can be read and reread over and over without exhausting their potential, cannot exist in great painting or in great music. This, Adler asserts, is because great painting and music do not engage in conversation (``They do not affirm or deny. They do not disagree and dispute''). His strongest example of this is Picasso's Guernica, a work of art whose meaning, expressed in words, could be as simple as ``war is hell.'' In keeping strict lines between what is written and what is painted or played, between the intellect and the senses, Adler remains firmly in line with the oldest of philosophical camps. And other than some interesting insights into the genesis of the Great Books and Great Ideas series, the illustrative material is uniformly bland. Those who are interested in future curriculums that are more inclusive of gender and nonwestern cultures will want to avoid this one. The plodding, sometimes pedantic style and extensive excerpts from previously published works make this long on definitions and reiterations, short on burning issues. -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Adler (Ten Philosophical Mistakes, LJ 4/1/ 85) provides a clear and compelling explication on the idea content of verbal and nonverbal arts. He moves from a history of the concept of fine art into a lively discourse on the "invention" of the "great ideas," an organizational device he developed for Britannica, Inc. in the early 1950s. Whether an art work is nonverbal (e.g., a statue or painting) or verbal (e.g., an epic poem), "the artist can say what he or she has in mind only by producing the work of art that he or she has in mind." This text serves as a useful and involving introduction to aesthetic philosophy, but one chapter is an excerpt from Ten Philosophical Mistakes and another reproduces far too much of the Great Books' Synopticon relative to the new content and discussion provided in this slim text.

Whether defending a wealthy celebrity or an indigent death row inmate, Black sees his job as doing whatever it takes to get his clients fair trials. In Black&#39;s Law, he takes us behind the scenes of four difficult and dangerous cases to reveal the legal strategies, no-holds-barred tactics and courtroom psychology he used to make sure his clients received every protection promised by the law. Black&#39;s cases illustrate the life-and-death struggles that occur every day in our criminal courts. In Alvarez, Black has to convince a jury to put aside poisonous pre-trial publicity, the threat of a race riot and almost universal pressure for a conviction in order to keep a young Hispanic police officer out of jail for killing a young black hoodlum in the line of duty. In Knight, Black must contend with issues of class and race as he wages a four-year struggle to persuade federal appeals court judges to overturn the death sentence imposed on an insane, brutal killer because of the incompetence of his first lawyers. In Hicks, Black has to prove the innocence of a client who is his own worst enemy by convincing a jury that the police conducted a sloppy murder investigation. And in De La Mata, Black must persuade jurors to disregard the damaging testimony of admitted drug dealers who have plea-bargained for lesser sentences in order to save a former bank president caught in the crosshairs of a federal prosecutor waging his own relentless war on drugs. At a time when the public and its elected officials are giving prosecutors and judges more power to put criminals behind bars, defense lawyers are often seen as being on the side of the bad guys. But Roy Black believes that when we chip away at the rights of the accused, we diminish our own rights as well. In our adversarial system, all too often the only person standing between a defendant and jail -- or the death penalty -- is the criminal defense lawyer. In these accounts, Black demonstrates in riveting detail how a defense attorney must investigate criminal cases by sifting through evidence and preparing for trial. (It&#39;s like preparing for a war.) He shows us how the principles of law, cross-examination and evidence -- as well as careful jury selection and skillful use of expert witnesses -- can level the playing field to counter the enormous resources that state and federal prosecutors have at their disposal. Black&#39;s Law reveals what really goes on in our criminal courts and makes resoundingly clear the crucial role that criminal defense lawyers play in safeguarding the basic right to a fair trial for all.</p><p>The title of criminal defense lawyer Roy Black's first book alludes to the renowned legal dictionary, and the reference is appropriate: Black is beyond a reasonable doubt the definitive defense attorney. Considered among the best advocates for the accused in the United States, he has had clients that included William Kennedy Smith and Marv Albert. But in <i>Black's Law</i>, the former public defender and law professor recounts the strategies and tactics he employed to safeguard the freedom of four lesser-known clients: Luis Alvarez, Thomas Knight, Steve Hicks, and Fred De La Mata.<p> In "Alvarez" (Black refers to each of his four examples by case name), a Miami cop is put on trial for shooting an African American suspect with no previous criminal record, pitting Black against the office of Dade County state attorney Janet Reno, who desperately needed a conviction to avert widespread race riots. In "Knight," Black must convince a federal appeals court that an insane multiple killer was condemned to death row by the bad lawyering of his first four attorneys. In "Hicks," a young bartender finds himself charged with murder after his girlfriend dies of an accidental gunshot wound; Black defends him against incriminating circumstantial evidence and the cluster-bungling efforts of police investigators. And in "De La Mata," Black takes a break from the murder trials to work on a money-laundering case.</p><p> The aforementioned <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> defines a defense attorney as "a [l]awyer who files appearance in behalf of defendant and represents such in civil or criminal case," but Roy Black's account underscores how such technical definitions fail to convey the essential role defense attorneys play in our adversarial system of justice. <i>Black's Law</i> is not just about four individual defendants, it's about the rights to which <i>all</i> defendants are entitled--and for which people like Roy Black fight--in a court of law. <i>--Tim Hogan</i></p><b>Roy Black</b> is one of America's most famous and respected criminal defense lawyers.

It was a trip that began in Egypt, passed beneath the steel and glass high rises of Saudi Arabia, then wound through the bullet- pocked alleyways of Beirut and dusty streets of Damascus, before ending at the cradle of the world&#x2019;s three major religions: Jerusalem.<br><i><br>Tea with Hezbollah</i> combines nail-biting narrative with the texture of rich historical background, as readers join novelist Ted Dekker and his co-author and Middle East expert, Carl Medearis, on a hair-raising journey. They are with them in every rocky cab ride, late-night border crossing, and back-room conversation as they sit down one-on-one with some of the most notorious leaders of the Arab world. These candid discussions with leaders of Hezbollah and Hamas, with muftis, sheikhs, and ayatollahs, with Osama bin Laden&#x2019;s brothers, reveal these men to be real people with emotions, fears, and hopes of their own. Along the way, Dekker and Medearis discover surprising answers and even more surprising questions that they could not have anticipated&#x2014;questions that lead straight to the heart of Middle Eastern conflict.<br><br>Through powerful narrative <i>Tea With Hezbollah</i> will draw the West into a completely fresh understanding of those we call our enemies and the teaching that dares us to love them.

The first clue should have come five days earlier when I received the call that the Hezbollah had just stormed the parliament buildings in Beirut, had declared their own form of martial law, and were killing dissenting party members who&#x2019;d taken up arms. A full-scale war had broken out in the very city Carl had talked me into visiting on this quest of ours. <br>Tanks and military vehicles, hundreds of them, were rolling down the streets. Citizens were fleeing. Hezbollah had seized control of the airport and stopped all flights. The American State Department had just issued a travel advisory, essentially prohibiting travel into the region.<br>I remember the call vividly. I was standing in a small luggage shop in my hometown of Austin, Texas, trying to decide whether the exorbitant price they were suggesting I pay for Tumi bags was worth the extra coin. I could buy a good Samsonite suitcase for a third the price.<br>It was then my cell phone chirped and I stepped out of the shop, glad for the distraction.<br>&#x201c;Have you heard the news?&#x201d; Carl asked in his ever-nonchalant voice.<br>&#x201c;What news?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Lebanon&#x2019;s at war.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Huh. Really?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The airport is shut down.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Wow. Really?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Many are reported killed.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Seriously?&#x201d;<br>You see, my own use of those words, <i>really </i>and <i>wow </i>and <i>seriously, </i>should have sealed the deal for me. Going to Beirut at a time like<i> </i>this was ill-advised. And going to Beirut to have tea with the top leaders<i> </i>of the Hezbollah, of all people, was now just plain absurd.<br>&#x201c;What about Saudi Arabia?&#x201d; I asked with as much bravado as I could muster. I was the apprentice here, playing the role of adventurer-in-training, and it was important that I didn&#x2019;t start squealing like a frightened child.<br>&#x201c;Well, this <i>is </i>the Middle East,&#x201d; Carl came back casually. &#x201c;Samir just evacuated his children on a private plane. He&#x2019;s adamant that we cancel the entire trip.&#x201d;<br>Samir. One of Carl&#x2019;s many friends in the Middle East, but unique in that Samir knows and is trusted by everyone. A linchpin for this trip, he was responsible for many of our appointments. If he said cancel, clearly we canceled.<br>My partner wasn&#x2019;t panicking, so I followed his most admirable example. I glanced back through the window where my wife, Lee Ann, was talking to the clerk about the Tumi bags. Naturally we wouldn&#x2019;t be needing either Tumi or Samsonite&#x2014;the world was coming to an end.<br>&#x201c;What about Syria?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&#x201c;Yeah, well, the road from Lebanon into Syria is blockaded with burning tires.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Seriously?&#x201d; Again that word. &#x201c;So our meeting with Assad&#x2019;s government&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Is now probably out of the question.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What about the West Bank? The Hamas?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Yeah, crazy, huh? Same with the bin Laden brothers in Saudi Arabia. The whole region could erupt. This is big news.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What does Chris think?&#x201d; Chris is Carl&#x2019;s Greek goddess, his marriage<br>partner who has given him three children and traveled the world at his side with superhuman grace. That&#x2019;s my take.<br>&#x201c;Yeah, she thinks the trip is dangerous.&#x201d;<br>Now that I think about it, I did take notice of those early clues that traveling through the Middle East to ask &#x201c;never before asked questions&#x201d; of Islam&#x2019;s most influential ideologues and America&#x2019;s &#x201c;enemies&#x201d; was a misguided mission. In fact, I distinctly remember feeling buckets of sweet, cool relief washing over my body as Carl broke the news.<br>The trip was off. I felt jovial! I was liberated from the fear that had nagged at me for many months as Carl slowly but surely put together this unprecedented trip.<br>Honestly, I never really thought he&#x2019;d pull it off. Without fail, my mention of the trip to publishers or people of influence would garner the same coy smile. &#x201c;Yeah, good luck with that.&#x201d; Who&#x2019;d ever heard of such a thing? I mean, it&#x2019;s one thing to sit in a coffee shop in downtown Denver and dream about the ultimate trip to the most dangerous parts of the world, but the list of people whom Carl wanted to meet amounted to a delusional dream. Or a nightmare, depending on your perspective.<br>Did I say delusional? Add impossible to that. No one from the State Department could get the meetings Carl was going after. In fact, no one but Carl Medearis could land them, but more on that later.<br>As the months stretched into a year and the appointments began falling into place, I tried to back out a dozen times. Finally, two days before we were scheduled to leave, God Himself had reached down and mercifully rescued me from almost certain death. Not to mention an overpriced luggage purchase. Being the puppy in tow of the great mastiff, I put on a brave face.<br>&#x201c;So, what do we do?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&#x201c;Well, we wait and see.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Wait for what?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;For things on the ground to change. Could all be fine tomorrow.&#x201d;<br>I&#x2019;m here to tell you that nothing was fine tomorrow. I&#x2019;m still not sure what&#x2014;besides foolishness&#x2014;put me on a flight from Denver to Cairo two days later.<br>And I&#x2019;m even less sure of what absurd notions could possibly have persuaded me to board the first flight into Beirut four days later, following a week&#x2019;s upheaval that had sent souls far braver than me either running for cover or to their graves.<br>Yet here I was, cranking open the vent over my head to dry the ribbons of sweat seeping from my forehead, never mind that the cabin was already freezing. Samir Kreidie, the wealthy Muslim businessman in Saudi Arabia who&#x2019;d helped to set up the trip, was returning to Beirut with us. Indeed, without his help, the trip would have been impossible&#x2014;many of the muftis and clerics we would meet agreed to do so only because of his unshakable reputation as a powerhouse of reconciliation.<br>But Samir himself, only days earlier, had insisted the trip was now far too dangerous.<br>Such is the Middle Eastern mind-set. I suppose when you spend your whole life dodging bullets, the threat of a sniper on the corner doesn&#x2019;t keep you housebound for long. Better to run rather than walk, naturally, but you can&#x2019;t let dissenters with machine guns make you a prisoner in your own house.<br>On the bright side, Carl, Samir, and I had virtually the whole jet to ourselves. It turns out that the owners of Middle East Airlines know Samir well. We&#x2019;d canceled our flights from Saudi Arabia to Beirut a few days earlier on my urging, during a time when all three of us possessed our full share of good sense. Rebooking would normally have been impossible at a time like this, but a single call from Samir and we were on. Such is the power of a man who spends the day talking to heads of state on his flip phone.<br>And business class to boot. Wonderful. The staff was excellent, as was the food. It was certainly better than any service I&#x2019;d experienced in the United States. The stewardesses all knew Samir&#x2014;no surprise there.<br>But the essential facts remained: One, Beirut was a city besieged by the Hezbollah. Two, we were on the first flight in after a week&#x2019;s closure. Three, according to reports, anywhere from dozens to hundreds had been killed in fighting around the city, and the Lebanese army controlled the streets only by lining them with tanks and machine-gun placements.<br>Four . . . I mean, please. Anything could happen. Anything.<br>Sometimes I feel like hugging Carl and slapping him on the back. The kind of guy who would befriend a starving grizzly bear, he is loved by all, and I do mean all. Other times I feel more like locking him in the bathroom and making a run for it. Both his love and his bravery are greater than mine.<br>Sweating bullets at thirty thousand feet and headed into the lion&#x2019;s den better known as Beirut, I was feeling the bathroom might be a good idea. But I had nowhere to run. I was committed.<br>No longer interested in stewing in my own fears, I turned to Carl. Thankfully, the seats in business class are large, because Carl&#x2014;a good Nebraska boy with blue eyes and a smile that won&#x2019;t quit&#x2014; stands six foot two and is built like the grizzly bears he befriends.<br>&#x201c;So you really think this is a good idea, huh?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Teddy, Teddy, you worry too much.&#x201d; His standard answer. I don&#x2019;t find it remotely comforting and I don&#x2019;t even try to smile.<br>&#x201c;Seriously, Carl.&#x201d; There&#x2019;s that word again. &#x201c;I got a bad feeling about this.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Samir wouldn&#x2019;t have agreed if it wasn&#x2019;t safe,&#x201d; he said.<br>I looked over at the wealthy Lebanese businessman who made his home in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. He grins and winks. Honestly, this is a man who could make the most hostile enemy lower his gun and settle down for a cup of tea. Being with him coaxes a perpetual smile from all in his presence. I&#x2019;d just spent two days smiling.<br>But that was before this flight.<br>I politely forced a smile and remembered that Samir went to extraordinary lengths to get his family out of Beirut just days ago. I&#x2019;d lain awake each night since then with visions roiling inside my head of gunmen bursting into my hotel room.<br>We&#x2019;d already been to Egypt and met with perhaps the most powerful ideologue in the Muslim world. We&#x2019;d spent three days in Saudi Arabia meeting with those who shaped Saudi thought, and we&#x2019;d sat down with Osama bin Laden&#x2019;s brothers. <br>I&#x2019;d heard countless nerve-wracking accounts that testified to the frailty of human life in this part of the world: the time when the CIA had kicked Carl and his family out of Lebanon for their own safety; the time when he was kidnapped at gunpoint in Iraq and very nearly assassinated; the time when Bonnie, one of his coworkers from the United States, was shot in the face and killed, south of Beirut. And this was just Carl&#x2014;everyone we met had a dozen similar cautionary tales of death or near death.<br>This was only the beginning of our trip. Ahead lay the gravest dangers, the West&#x2019;s greatest perceived enemies, the making and unmaking of war: Beirut, Baalbek, southern Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank.<br>I&#x2019;ve had my encounters with danger, naturally. I was born in the jungles of Indonesia, where my parents spent their lives as missionaries among headhunters. The father of one of my best friends was killed and consumed by the cannibals in the valley next to ours. He was one of two missionaries who were eaten by the locals when I was a child. I saw war and destruction, and I&#x2019;ve had more than my share of close encounters with death.<br>But that was my life before I turned twenty. Since I&#x2019;ve been living as an adult in America, the danger I&#x2019;ve faced has been of my own making&#x2014;the dark antagonists who populate my novels. <br>Now I was facing real danger again, and it made my blood run cold. Honestly, I was having difficulty remembering exactly why we were subjecting ourselves to this madness.<br>&#x201c;Carl, remind me again exactly what we hope to accomplish with all of this,&#x201d; I said, turning back to my friend of fifteen years.<br>&#x201c;Well . . .&#x201d; For the hundredth time we rehearsed our ambitions.<br>It all started nearly two years earlier when Carl Medearis, the man with a thousand stories and ten thousand friends, had lunch with one of those friends, Ted Dekker, the man who has befriended his computer keyboard. It was a pleasant day in July and we sat in an<br>outdoor patio at a Hard Rock Cafe on the Sixteenth Street Mall, downtown Denver. Our wives, Chris and Lee Ann, were deep in a discussion about traveling abroad; Carl and I had each other&#x2019;s ear.<br>&#x201c;Tell me, Ted,&#x201d; said my good friend, &#x201c;what is one thing Martin Luther King, Gandhi, and Jesus have in common?&#x201d;<br>I thought for a moment. &#x201c;They were all murdered?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Actually, that&#x2019;s right. And they all died for the same message, at least in large part. So, what was that message?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;Tell me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;To love your neighbor. Even if they&#x2019;re the enemy.&#x201d;<br>I nodded. &#x201c;They make us all look like hypocrites. Is it really possibleto love your enemy?&#x201d;<br>We both fell into a few moments of introspection. Then Carl looked up with bright eyes.<br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t we find out?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Seriously.&#x201d; That word. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t we go to this country&#x2019;s greatest so-called enemies and ask them what they think about this scandalous teaching.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The Middle East?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not just the Middle East. The Hamas, the Hezbollah. The greatest minds and influencers in Islam.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And ask them what they think of Martin Luther King, Gandhi, and Jesus?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s a thought. The parable of the Samaritan is probably the most famous teaching on loving your neighbors. Muslims revere Jesus, who gave the teaching. We could start with that.&#x201d;<br>He actually was serious.<br>&#x201c;So we go together, sit at the table of our greatest enemies.&#x201d; I paused. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re talking about one of the most complicated regions of the world, brimming with violence. Huge divides between Muslims, Jews, and Christians. Bus bombs, terrorism, massive loss of life . . . You honestly think anything we hoped to accomplish with a trip to the Middle East would really do anyone any good?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It would do me good,&#x201d; Carl said. &#x201c;And it would do the people we talked to good. Talking is always good.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re talking about the people who blew up the Twin Towers! Thousands of our soldiers and citizens have lost their lives at the hands of Muslims. They want to push Israel into the sea, for heaven&#x2019;s sake. Talking would do no good.&#x201d;<br>He shrugged. &#x201c;Maybe not. But it would be one heck of trip. Imagine it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I am, that&#x2019;s the problem. My imagination is pretty good and I&#x2019;m imagining nothing but trouble.&#x201d; Pause. &#x201c;You really think you could set it up?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It will be difficult, but yeah, I think I can.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We sit with these so-called enemies, ask them what their favorite joke is, and what they think of the parable of the Samaritan, which teaches us to love our neighbors even if they are our enemies. And we do it all to discover if anyone really can love his enemy. That about it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Pretty much, yes. And in writing about it all for an American audience, we would be sitting Americans at the table with their enemies. We&#x2019;ll let them decide what to do with this radical teaching that got Martin Luther King, Gandhi, and Jesus killed. I would be willing to go out on a limb for that.&#x201d;<br>He stared at me and his lips slowly curled into a daring smile. When Carl talks about going out on a limb, it brings to my mind the time he went out on a limb in Iraq and was kidnapped at gunpoint. I have no desire to follow Carl out on his limbs.<br>&#x201c;Sounds dangerous.&#x201d; But man, imagine the book. &#x201c;You could really pull off meetings like that?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;If I could . . . Interested?&#x201d;<br>I let my mind go. The idea suddenly sounded irresistible, in part because it seemed so impossible. A protected fantasy.<br>&#x201c;Maybe. If you could, maybe I could. Maybe. <i>If </i>you could.&#x201d;<br>As it turned out, he could. And he did.<br>It took Carl a year to talk me from a <i>maybe </i>to a <i>yes. </i>It took another year to line it up. And a third to write the book. Though Carl and I are about as similar as the mastiff and the puppy, we do share some basic points of connection. We both used to live in Colorado, where we first met eighteen years ago.

Philip Ziegler has had full access to all the papers in the Royal archives - crucial letters to and from Edward&#39;s mother, Queen Mary, and his brother George VI, as well as diaries and letters of others in the household are quoted here for the first time. From his childhood to his restless adolescence as Prince of Wales, from his first serious affair (with Freda Dudley Ward) to his falling in love with Mrs Simpson - the background to the abdication is described in detail from the protagonists&#39; own writings.</p><p>Philip Ziegler was born in 1929 and educated at Eton and Oxford. He was a diplomat before becoming an editorial director at the publishers William Collins. His many books include acclaimed biographies of William IV, Lady Diana Cooper, Lord Mountbatten and Harold Wilson, as well as the classic history of the Black Death. His authorised biography of Edward Heath won the Elizabeth Longford Prize in 2011.This is quite certainly the best and now the definitive biography of the beleaguered Duke of Windsor. Ziegler is sympathetic, but does not mince words in reporting misdeeds. None yet can entirely supplant Frances Donaldson's standard King Edward VIII ( LJ 3/15/75), but Ziegler has the advantage of access to much recent research, and pulls it all together in an account that is judicious, informed, and above all highly readable. There have been so many Windsor books that librarians will look for reasons not to purchase another. This is not the one to reject. However, don't discard your biographies of the Duchess--she is, surprisingly, a secondary figure in this masterful study of the King and ex-King who gave up a throne for the woman he loved.

The answer to this, according to Phillips, lies in a close examination of three internecine English-speaking civil warsï¿½the English Civil War, the American Revolution, and the American Civil War. These wars between cousins functioned as crucial anvils on which various religious, ethnic, and political alliances were hammered out between the English-speaking cousin-nations, setting them on a unique two-track path toward world leadership - one aristocratic and aloof to dominate the imperial nineteenth century and the other more egalitarian and democratic to take over in the twentieth century. They also functioned as unfortunate and deadly cultural crucibles for African Americans, Native Americans, and the Irish.Phillips's analysis shows exactly how these conflicts are inextricably linked and how they seeded each other. He offers often surprising interpretations that cut across the political spectrum - for instance, that the Constitution of the United States, while brilliant in many respects, was also a fatally flawed political compromise that contributed mightily in setting the stage for the final - and the bloodiest - cousins' war: the American Civil War.With the new millennium upon us and triggering widespread assessment of our nation's place in world history, <i>The Cousins' Wars</i> provides just the kind of magisterial sweep and revisionist spark to ignite widespread interest and debate. This grand religious, military, and political epic is the multi-dimensional story of the triumph of Anglo-America.</p><p>Political commentator Kevin Phillips (author of the 1991 bestseller <i>The Politics of Rich and Poor</i>) takes a break from analyzing the latest election returns with this sweeping history of Anglo-American exceptionalism. How did the political culture of Anglo-America rise "from a small Tudor kingdom to a global community and world hegemony"? asks Phillips. His answer comes in the course of studying three wars--the English Civil War, the American Revolution, and the U.S. Civil War. Phillips does not examine the military history of these conflicts, looking instead at the political, religious, economic, and sectional interests that shaped them. He makes several eye-opening observations, comparing, for instance, a "state-by-state portrait of which counties, towns, districts, or regions were loyal" during the American Revolution to "ethnoreligious maps of the modern-day Balkans." This is a hefty book (over 600 pages, not including appendices and footnotes), and while Phillips's preface is a bit self-absorbed, admirers of David Landes's <i>The Wealth and Poverty of Nations</i> and Jared Diamond's <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i> will find much to like between its covers. <i>--John J. Miller</i>Praise for this title <p>"This is an elegant and provocative book...Phillips not only seeks out the religious foundations of political differences but finds an underlying Anglo-America that has not only endured despite these wars but has decisively reshaped the modern world. Not everyone will agree with everything Phillips says, but he does offer a bold synthesis that ought to stimulate public debate while it helps to enlighten us all." --John M. Murrin, Professor of History, Princeton University </p><p>"Kevin Phillips has written a remarkable book, tracing subterranean psychological and spiritual connections across decades of peace and war that most historians have ignored. His insights on the religious undercurrents of the American Revolution are particularly striking." --Tom Fleming, author of Liberty: The American Revolution </p><p>"If international politics on planet earth really is about 'the clash of cultures,' then Kevin Phillips has just told the story of the winner." --Byron E. Shafer, Andrew Mellon Professor of American Government, Oxford University </p><p>"The Cousins Wars is an exciting review of Anglo-America in the making." --Walter Dean Burnham, Frank C.

The United States is the planet&#x2019;s number-one producer of trash. Each American throws out 4.5 pounds daily. But garbage is also a global problem; the Pacific Ocean is today six times more abundant with plastic waste than zooplankton. How did we end up with this much rubbish, and where does it all go? Journalist and filmmaker Heather Rogers answers these questions by taking readers on a grisly, oddly fascinating tour through the underworld of garbage.</p> <p>Said to &#x201c;read like a thriller&#x201d; (<i>Library Journal</i>), <i>Gone Tomorrow</i> excavates the history of rubbish handling from the 1800s to the present, pinpointing the roots of today&#x2019;s waste-addicted society. With a &#x201c;lively authorial voice&#x201d; (<i>New York Press</i>), Rogers draws connections between modern industrial production, consumer culture, and our throwaway lifestyle. She also investigates controversial topics like the politics of recycling and the export of trash to poor countries, while offering a potent argument for change.</p> <br></p><p>Heather Rogers is a journalist and filmmaker. Her documentary film <i>Gone Tomorrow</i> (2002) screened in festivals around the globe. Her writing has appeared in <i>The Nation</i>, <i>Utne Reader</i>, <i>Z Magazine</i>, the <i>Brooklyn Rail</i>, <i>Punk Planet</i>, and <i>Art and Design</i>. She lives in Brooklyn, New York.<br>*Starred Review* America leads the world in garbage, and that is nothing to be proud of. A clear-thinking and peppery writer, Rogers presents a galvanizing expose of how we became the planet's trash monsters. Americans were ingeniously thrifty until industrialization ushered in consumer culture and the age of disposable goods and built-in obsolescence. But once the public was exhorted to buy stuff whether they needed it or not--and Rogers provides many eye-opening examples of corporate strategies and propaganda--new forms of garbage began to pile up and break down into toxic substances. Rogers details everything that is wrong with today's wasteful packaging, bogus recycling, and flawed landfills and incinerators. Here, too, is the inside story of the plastic revolution and the irresponsibly wasteful beverage market, the Mafia's involvement in commercial waste, and the illegal overseas shipping of garbage, especially toxic e-waste--trashed computers and cell phones. Rogers exhibits black-belt precision in her assault on American corporations that succeed in "greenwashing" the public while remaining "hell-bent on ever-expanding production no matter what the ecological toll." Set this beside Elizabeth Royte's <i>Garbage Land </i>(2005), and contemplate Rogers' dictum: garbage "never really goes away." <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

He had never been declared insane by a medical professional or found guilty of any criminal charge. But he was deaf and black in the Jim Crow South. <i>Unspeakable</i> is the story of his life.<br><br>Using legal records, institutional files, and extensive oral history interviews--some conducted in sign language--Susan Burch and Hannah Joyner piece together the story of a deaf man accused in 1925 of attempted rape, found insane at a lunacy hearing, committed to the criminal ward of the State Hospital for the Colored Insane, castrated, forced to labor for the institution, and held at the hospital for more than seven decades. Junius Wilson's life was shaped by some of the major developments of twentieth-century America: Jim Crow segregation, the civil rights movement, deinstitutionalization, the rise of professional social work, and the emergence of the deaf and disability rights movements. In addition to offering a bottom-up history of life in a segregated mental institution, Burch and Joyner's work also enriches the traditional interpretation of Jim Crow by highlighting the complicated intersections of race and disability as well as of community and language. <br><br>This moving study expands the boundaries of what biography can and should be. There is much to learn and remember about Junius Wilson--and the countless others who have lived unspeakable histories.<br><br></p><p>"American deaf history is steeped with the presence of African American deaf people, but there is precious little written about them, or about black deaf schools and the sign language of black deaf communities. This book tells the story of one African American deaf man who was born in the early twentieth century, at a time when segregated black deaf schools were found in every state in the South, and when ignorance about sign languages and deaf people was deeply institutionalized. Through a blend of scholarship and skillful narrative, the authors guide the reader through a history of the twentieth century as it was lived by one man whose skin color and condition of deafness made him a victim of many institutional failures, condemning him to spend his entire adult life in a mental institution."--Carol Padden, University of California, San Diego <br>Susan Burch has taught history at Gallaudet University; Charles University, Czech Republic; and the University of Aberdeen, Scotland.

A New Yorker editor for 40 years and American Book Award recipient for his 1980 novel, So Long, See You Tomorrow, Maxwell has selected 23 short stories and 21 "improvisations" that he deems worth saving. All the tales from Over by the River and Other Stories (1977) and from Billie Dyer and Other Stories (1992) are included, as are 16 of the 29 improvisations originally published as The Old Man at the Railroad Crossing and Other Tales (1966). Three strong uncollected stories-"A Game of Chess," "The Lily-White Boys" and "What He Was Like"-as well as six new improvisations complete the group. Maxwell has always braided his family history into his storyteller's art, and the first section here draws much from his experiences as a boy in Lincoln, Ill. (where he was born in 1908), from time spent in France and from contemporary life in New York. In these stories, people frequently suffer under the misapprehension that they understand those around them, or even themselves, and are recurrently made restless by indefinable dreams or fears. The keys to deliverance are, invariably for Maxwell, compassion and love. The improvisations, which make up the second section, are "spontaneous inventions" created for special occasions, such as his wife's birthday, commemorated in the fine title piece. Many begin with "Once upon a time" and become linear, sometimes enigmatic fables for adults, illuminating issues of commitment, betrayal, death, personal responsibility and human kindness. This volume is conclusive evidence that Maxwell stands at the pinnacle of American letters. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Maxwell has been called one of American literature's best-kept secrets, though he has a loyal and passionate following. Now his devoted fans as well as readers new to his quiet magic will be able to appreciate the full range of his storytelling powers. This majestic collection contains 23 stories written over the course of 53 years as well as a set of charming, fablelike "improvisations" written, as Maxwell explains in his preface, to "please" his wife. In each enveloping and poignant tale, Maxwell deftly traces the spiraling of emotions concealed within his restrained characters, embroidering his meticulous and beautifully modulated stories on the unevenly textured fabric of life itself, where fineness and coarseness are woven together in no reliable pattern. In "Over by the River," for example, a Manhattan family possesses all the accoutrements of a comfortable, happy life, but parents and children alike have nightmares, subconsciously attuned to the fact that the world is intrinsically unsafe. Time, change, and loss also occupy Maxwell's attention, a theme he explores to exquisite effect in "The Gardens of Mont-Saint-Michel," a story about an American family on vacation in France, and in "The Value of Money," one of Maxwell's masterful stories about Draperville, Illinois. In this tale, a man visiting his father is struck by the stories an old friend of the family tells him: "Dr. McBride understood the use of the surprising juxtaposition, the impact of things left unsaid." This, of course, describes Maxwell's gift to a tee. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>In Dubious Battle</h2><p>Set in California apple country, a strike by migrant workers spirals out of control, as principled defiance turns into blind fanaticism.

Armstrong&nbsp;</i></b><br>&nbsp;<br>Robert Trent Jones was the most prolific and influential golf course architect of the twentieth century and became the&nbsp;archetypical modern&nbsp;golf course designer. Jones spread the gospel of golf by designing courses in forty-two US states and twenty-eight countries. Twenty U.S. Opens, America&#x2019;s national championship, have been contested on Jones-designed courses.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>New York Times </i>bestselling biographer James R. Hansen, author of <i>First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong</i>, recounts how&nbsp;an&nbsp;English immigrant boy arrived in upstate New York in 1912, just as golf was emerging as a popular pastime in America. Jones excelled as a golfer, earning admission to Cornell University, whose faculty consented to a curriculum tailored to teach him the knowledge needed to&nbsp;design golf courses.&nbsp;Cornell provided the springboard for an act of self-invention that propelled Jones from obscurity to worldwide fame. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Jones&nbsp;believed&nbsp;that every hole should be &#x201c;a&nbsp;difficult par but an easy bogey.&#x201d; As gifted as he was at golf design, Jones was equally skilled as a salesman, promoter, and entrepreneur. <i>Golf Digest</i>&#x2019;s annual rankings of the 100 Greatest Golf Courses have regularly featured about fifty Jones designs, paving the path for his two sons, Robert Jr., and Rees, whose work would carry on their father&#x2019;s tradition.

ON A horse with a noose around my neck, my hands tied behind my back, and the steed about to be whipped out from under me, I could already feel el diablo&#x2019;s hot claws gripping my ankles tightly, ready to pull me down after the rope strangled me.<br>I held my legs tight against each side of the stallion&#x2019;s flank, a signal that he would recognize as a command not to bolt. He and I had been through a lot together. We knew each other well&#x2014;or so I hoped.<br>The coarse rope&#x2014;tied to a thick branch overhead that had been chosen to bear my weight without breaking&#x2014;was biting into my neck, the slipknot choking me, threatening to crush my windpipe and cut off my breathing each time the nervous horse moved.<br>My wrists were raw from trying to pull and twist my hands out of the bindings. I didn&#x2019;t care if blood ran freely from them so long as it helped get my hands loose, but the hacienda owners&#x2014;the hacendados&#x2014;who had captured me had had their vaqueros tie the cords too tight.<br>As a man of many professions that brought me into close contact with the king&#x2019;s constables&#x2014;horse thief, bandido, and impersonator of a wealthy caballero, to name a few of my trades&#x2014;I knew only too well what would happen when my captors swatted the horse&#x2019;s rump with a quirt and caused the spirited stallion to bolt out from under me.<br>I would be left hanging&#x2014;literally&#x2014;but it would not kill me. Not quickly, at least. Dying would take an excruciating amount of time because of the short fall off of the horse. That is what hanging is all about, amigos&#x2014;the length of the fall before the loop tightens around a person&#x2019;s neck.<br>Being lynched in the forest by vigilantes meant I would be pulled off the horse as he surged forward and drop only a couple of feet. That would leave me dangling at the end of the rope to slowly suffocate.<br>Unfortunately, since I am young and strong, it will take perhaps half an hour or more for that coarse rope around my neck to squeeze the life out of me, as I twisted, kicked, and jerked, my face bloated and red, blood foaming out of my mouth, my eyes bulging from their sockets.<br>Ayyo! Perhaps I should have been a priest instead of a bad man, but that was not the path that the Fates&#x2014;those three remorseless old crones who decide our destinies&#x2014;had set me upon. Had they a bit of mercy in their immortal souls they would have seen to it that I fell into the clutches of constables rather than arrogant Spanish horse owners who were only too ready to throw a rope over a branch rather than take the time and effort of getting the authorities involved.<br>The Spanish viceroy had had gallows erected in the Zï¿½calo, the main square in Mexico City, as a reminder to the indios that he was in control of the colony. The gallows were built high so that when the trapdoor opened beneath the prisoner&#x2019;s feet, he fell far enough for the fall to snap his neck&#x2014;if the noose was tied and the knot placed correctly, of course. And if the prisoner&#x2019;s family crossed the hangman&#x2019;s palm with a coin or two, a sack of sand was tied to the prisoner&#x2019;s feet to increase the chances of his neck breaking.<br>The hanged man was still strangled by the rope, but a broken neck caused a much quicker loss of consciousness and death.<br>Such were the dark thoughts that were going through my head as the Spaniards discussed my fate&#x2014;not whether I would be hanged, of course, but how quickly it would occur. One of them actually wanted to get a priest to give me last rites&#x2014;bless that man&#x2019;s pious soul!&#x2014;but I could tell that his argument about it being the Christian thing to do was not setting well with the others who wanted a taste of blood&#x2014;<i>my blood</i>.<br>The man who favored a priest even wanted to know my name, and I made up one because my true name, Juan the Lï¿½pero, would have hurried the hanging even more because lï¿½peros were street trash considered worse than lice and accursed by God.<br>The proof to me that those hags called the Fates had gotten an iron grip on my cojones and squeezed tight had to do with the strange twist about the mare&#x2014;I was being hanged for stealing, but I had actually not stolen her. The Spaniards refused to believe that the mare was simply following me because she enjoyed the tune I was humming.<br>I didn&#x2019;t blame the hacendados&#x2014;I wouldn&#x2019;t have believed the story myself if I were them&#x2014;but it happened to be the truth, in a manner of speaking. I <i>was</i> humming a tune and the mare <i>did</i> follow me.<br>There were other times when I hummed that same tune and horses followed me. Sï¿½, I do not deny it&#x2014;I am a horse thief and I am able to make a sound that soothes horses and attracts them to me. Except this time I hadn&#x2019;t intended to steal the horse, at least that was not what I had set out to do. Acting from habit, I was just practicing the method I had used many times in the past with horses.<br>So I suppose one could say that in the eyes of Seï¿½ora Justice, I was not being hanged for stealing this mare, but for the many other horses I had stolen in the past&#x2014;but she is blind, no?<br>Truthfully, I don&#x2019;t wish to be hanged, period. However, I will admit that if anyone deserved to swing on the rope for horse stealing, it would be me.<br>But now was not the time, because forty-eight years after the defeat of the Aztecs and conquest by the Spanish of the One-World, I was on a mission to unravel a puzzle and solve a mystery about the finest horses of the colony.<br>Horses are, of course, <i>everything</i> in the colony. That is why I was being hanged so quickly.<br>Had I stolen the wife or daughter of a hacendado, my sentencing to death would have taken much longer. But to steal a horse&#x2014;that was a mortal sin above the murder of a human being.<br>Many thoughts go through a man&#x2019;s mind when he is about to be hanged as a horse thief. Could I have run faster to escape? Chosen a different horse to steal? Shouted my innocence louder?<br>Did you expect me to be remorseful about my choice of occupation? Perhaps wish that I had been a priest smelling of wine and righteousness instead? Or a merchant with my heart pumping and my hands sweaty, counting my coins?<br>If you thought those trades were open to one who carries the blood taint of mixed indio and Spanish blood, you have been eating some of those mushrooms that indio healers use to open their minds so they might speak to the gods.<br>No, I was a horse thief&#x2014;born to hang.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright ï¿½ 2012 by Eugene Winick, Executor, Estate of Gary Jennings<br></p><h2>300 Years of American Seating Furniture</h2><p>With 18 color and 400 black and white illustrations.</p><p></p><h2>Stanley and Rhoda</h2><p>In three episodes a brother and sister deal with Rhoda&#39;s untidy room, a bee sting, and a baby sitter.</p><p></p><h2>Homespun Handknit: Caps, socks, mittens &amp; gloves</h2><p>From easy beginner pieces to advanced brain teasers, &#39;Homespun Handknit&#39; provides a unique range of small projects, instructions and ideas to keep you knitting creatively for years to come.</p><p>Linda Collier Ligon started Interweave Press on her dining room table in 1975 after her third child was born.

Set during three pivotal decades of Irish history, the narrative focuses on four men who participate in the short-lived Rising of 1867 and the irrevocable effects on their lives of the battle of Clonbrony Wood. Ned Nolan returns from America to his hometown of Kilpeder to lead the uprising, programmed by the Irish Republican Brotherhoodthe Fenianswhose sacred oath is the motivating obsession of Ned's existence. He enlists the aid of three of Kilpeder's young men: schoolmaster Hugh MacMahon, Robert Delaney, a bright, ambitious shopkeeper's assistant, and Vincent Tully, charming wastrel son of the town's leading merchant. In the aftermath of the aborted rebellion, Ned hardens into a merciless terrorist. Bob becomes a solicitor, an MP in the party of Charles Stewart Parnell and the lover of the wife of the Earl of Ardmor, who "owns" Kilpeder and lives in an estate overlooking the town. Except for Hugh, who is one of the narrators of this moving story, tragedy stalks each of the veterans of Clonbrony Wood. Their intertwined life dramas are played out against the tragedy of Ireland's bloody attempts to shake the yoke of British rule. The novel beautifully integrates the lives of its fictional characters with a striking depiction of the historical circumstances that motivated rebellion against the Crown. Flanagan's portrayal of the texture of Irish society illuminates the roots of perennial conflict. He skillfully describes the rise of Charles Parnell and the success of the Land League campaign, Parnell's disgrace and the destruction of all his accomplishments while the "damned bloody empire . . . settled back to watch the Irish tear ourselves to pieces." As in all tragedy, there is irony: of Irish informers betraying their compatriots; of Parnell's sudden fall just as home rule seems certain; of the way Bob Delaney's life mirrors that of his leader's. Written in musical prose and imbued with an elegiac strain, the novel also eulogizes the innocence, hope and idealism of youth, which, because "we are all the tenants of Time," gives way to the disillusionment and bitter accommodations of one's maturer years. A fine fusion of solid historical and sociological insight with a shrewd, sensitive grasp of character, plus a steady sweep of dramatic momentum incorporating an affecting portrait of a doomed love affair, this is a book one does not want to put down. It is a significant literary achievement, as timely as today's headlines about violence in Ireland. 100,000 first printing; $100,000 ad/promo; BOMC featured alternate. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.Flanagan's The Year of the French was a popular, award-winning, and masterful account of the Irish uprising of 1798. This novel deals with the years between the failed Fenian uprising of 1867 and the death of Parnell late in 1891. Parnell and the Land League agitation of the 1880s had a revolutionary effect upon Irish history. Flanagan vividly shows how the personal histories of his many characters both created and were changed by the history of their times. The nature and meaning of history is one of the themes of this book, as is the way history is remembered and recorded. Flanagan has the mind of a philosophical historian, but also the talent of a gifted storyteller. A model of historical fiction.

What drove Michael Jordan? The pursuit of team success...or of his own personal glory? The pursuit of excellence...or of his next multimillion-dollar endorsement? The flight of the man they call Air Jordan had been rocked by controversy. In <i>The Jordan Rules,</i> which chronicles the Chicago Bulls' first championship season, Sam Smith takes the #1 Bull by the horns to reveal the team behind the man...and the man behind the Madison Avenue smile. Here is the inside game, both on and off the court, including: <br> <ul> <li>Jordan's power struggles with management, from verbal attacks on the general manager to tantrums against his coach </li><li>Behind-the-scenes feuds, as Jordan punches a teammate in practice and refuses to pass the ball in the crucial minutes of big games </li><li>The players who competed with His Airness for Air Time -- Scottie Pippen, Horace Grant, Bill Cartwright -- telling their sides of the story </li><li>A penetrating look at coach Phil Jackson, the former flower child who blossomed into one of the NBA's top motivators and who finally found a way to coax "Michael and the Jordanaires" to the their first title </li></ul> <br> A provocative eyewitness account, <i>The Jordan Rules</i> delivers all the nonstop excitement, tension, and thrills of a championship season -- and an intense, fascinating portrait of the incomparable Michael Jordan.</p><p>Sam Smith was a reporter for the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> during the Chicago Bulls' 1991 championship season. He is a Brooklyn native with degrees in accounting from Pace University and in journalism from Ball State University. He is the author of <i>The Jordan Rules </i>and <i>Second Coming. </i>He lives in Illinois with his family.<b>Chapter One: Spring 1990</b><br>Michael Jordan surveyed his crew and got that sinking feeling.<br>It was just before 11:00 A.M. on May 24, 1990, two days after the Bulls had fallen behind the Detroit Pistons two games to none in the Eastern Conference finals. The city of was awash in spring -- all two hours of it, as the old-time residents like to say -- but Jordan wasn't feeling very sunny. He didn't even feel like playing golf, which friends would say meant he was near death.<br>The Bulls had gathered for practice at the Deerfield Multiplex, a tony health club about thirty-five miles north of Chicago, to try to get themselves back into the series. Jordan's back hurt, as did his hip, shoulder, wrist, and thigh, thanks to a two-on-one body slam in Game 1 courtesy of Dennis Rodman and John Salley. But his back didn't hurt nearly as much as his pride or his competitiveness, for the Bulls were being soundly whipped by the Pistons, and Jordan was growing desperately angry and frustrated.<br>"I looked over and saw Horace [Grant] and Scottie [Pippen] screwing around, joking and messing up," Jordan told an acquaintance later. "They've got the talent, but they don't take it seriously. And the rookies were together, as usual. They've got no idea what it's all about. The white guys [John Paxson and Ed Nealy], they work hard, but they don't have the talent. And the rest of them? Who knows what to expect? They're not good for much of anything."<br>It was a burden Michael Jordan felt he had to bear. The weight of the entire team was on his tired shoulders.<br>The Pistons had taken the first two games by 86-77 and 102-93, and Detroit's defense had put the Bulls' fast break in neutral: The Bulls had failed to shoot better than 41 percent in either game. Jordan himself had averaged only 27 points, stubbornly going 17 for 43. No team defensed Jordan better than the Pistons, yet he refused to admit that they gave him a hard time, so he played into their hands by attacking the basket right where their collapsing defensive schemes were expecting him. The coaches would look on in exasperation as Jordan drove toward the basket -- "the citadel," assistant coach John Bach liked to call it -- like a lone infantryman attacking a fortified bunker. Too often there was no escape.<br>Although Detroit's so-called Jordan rules of defense were effective, the Bulls coaches also believed the Pistons had succeeded in pulling a great psychological scam on the referees. It had been a two-part plan. The first step was a series of selectively edited tapes, sent to the league a few years earlier, which purported to show bad fouls being called on defenders despite little contact with Jordan. The Pistons said they weren't even being allowed to defense him. "Ever since then, the foul calls started decreasing," Jordan noted, "and not only those against Detroit."<br>Step two was the public campaign. The Pistons advertised their "Jordan rules" as some secret defense that only they could deploy to stop Jordan. These secrets were merely a series of funneling defenses that channeled Jordan toward the crowded middle, but Detroit players and coaches talked about them as if they had been devised by the Pentagon. "You hear about them often enough -- and the referees bear it, too -- and you start to think they have something different," said Bach. "It has an effect and suddenly people think they aren't fouling Michael even when they are."<br>It only added to Jordan's frustration with Detroit.<br>At halftime of Game 2, with the Bulls trailing 53-38, Jordan walked into the quiet locker room, kicked over a chair, and yelled, "We're playing like a bunch of pussies!" Afterward, he refused to speak to reporters, boarded the bus, and sat in stony silence all the way home. He continued his silence -- other than a few sharp postgame statements -- for the next week. He would not comment on his teammates. "I'll let them stand up and take responsibility for themselves," he told a friend.<br>Jordan had really believed that the Bulls could defeat Detroit this time. Of course, there was no evidence to suggest it could happen, since the Pistons had knocked the Bulls out of the playoffs the previous two seasons and had taken fourteen of the last seventeen regular-season games between them. But hadn't there been similar odds in 1989 when the Bulls had faced Cleveland in the playoffs? The Cavaliers had won fifty-seven games that season to the Bulls' forty-seven, and they were 6-0 against the Bulls, even winning the last game of the regular season despite resting their starters while the Bulls played theirs. The Bulls' chances were as bleak as Chicago in February.<br>Jordan promised that the Bulls would win the Cleveland series anyway.<br>Playing point guard, Jordan averaged 39.8 points, 8.2 assists, and 5.8 rebounds in the five games. And with time expiring in Game 5, he hit a hanging jumper to give the Bulls a 1-point victory. The moment became known in Chicago sports history as "the shot," ranking with Jordan's other "shot" in the 1982 NCAA tournament, a twenty-foot jumper that gave North Carolina a last-second victory over Georgetown. It also sent the Cavaliers plummeting; over the next two seasons, they would not defeat the Bulls once.<br>The playoffs had become Jordan's stage. He was Bob Hope and Michael Jackson, Mick Jagger and Frank Sinatra. His play transcended the game. It was a sweet melody received with a grand ovation. Others jumped as high and almost everyone slammed the ball, but Jordan did it with a style and a smile and a flash and a wink, and he did it best in the postseason.<br>"There's always been the feeling on this team," Bach had said after that Cavaliers series, "that if we got to the Finals, Michael would figure out some way to win it. He's the greatest competitor I've ever seen and then he goes to still another level in the big games."<br>It was true: Jordan's playoff performances had been Shakespearean sonnets, beautiful and timeless. And like Shakespeare, he was the best even though everyone said so. In just his second season in the league, after missing sixty-four games with a broken foot, Jordan demanded to return to the court despite warnings by doctors that he might exacerbate the injury to his foot. The Bulls, and even Jordan's advisers, said he should sit out the rest of the season. Jordan angrily accused the team of not wanting to make the playoffs so it could get a better draft pick. He was reluctantly allowed to return with only fifteen games remaining in the regular schedule. The Bulls made the playoffs, and in Game 2 against the Boston Celtics (who would go on to win the NBA title) Jordan scored 63 points. Larry Bird put it this way: "It must be God disguised as Michael Jordan."<br>In the 1988 playoffs against the Cavaliers, Jordan opened the series with 50- and 55-point games, the first time anyone had ever scored back-to-back 50s in the playoffs, to lead the team to victory and establish an all-time five-game-playoff-series scoring record of 45.2 points per game. Jordan had become perhaps the greatest scorer in the game's history. He would never equal Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game or his hundred-plus 50-point games, but by the end of 1990-91 season, Jordan had become the all-time NBA scoring average leader in the regular season, the playoffs, and the All-Star game. And he'd won his fifth straight scoring title, putting him behind only Chamberlain's seven.<br>And now, facing the Pistons in 1990, he was coming off a series against the 76ers in the second round of the playoffs that was unbelievable even by his own amazing standards. The Bulls won in five games as Jordan averaged 43 points, 7.4 assists, and 6.6 rebounds. He shot nearly 55 percent in 42.5 minutes per game. He drove and he dunked. He posted up and buried jumpers. He blocked shots and defended everyone from Charles Barkley to Johnny Dawkins.<br>"I never played four consecutive games like I did against Philly," he said of the first four, in which he led the team in scoring in thirteen of sixteen quarters.<br>And then the Bulls, storming and snorting, headed for Detroit to take on the Pistons. The two teams hailed from hard-edged, blue-collar towns, Chicago with its broad shoulders and meat-packing history, Detroit with its recession-prone auto industry. For some reason, though, Detroit's sports teams seemed to have a perpetual edge over Chicago's. In 1984 the Cubs finally won a piece of a baseball tide, but it was the Detroit Tigers who won the World Series, just as they had in 1945, the year of the Cubs' last World Series appearance. Many times Gordie Howe's Detroit Red Wings had come into the Stadium and ruined the dreams of Bobby Hull's Black Hawks. And now there were the Pistons. Detroit had made a habit of beating Chicago. It was a habit Michael Jordan was determined to break.<br>But no matter how hard he tried against the Pistons, he couldn't beat these guys. In earlier seasons, Jordan had some of his biggest scoring games against the Pistons: a 61-point mosaic in an overtime win in March 1987, an Easter Sunday mural on national TV in 1988 in which he'd scored 59 points. And Jordan <i>was</i> an artist, the ninety-four-by-fifty-foot basketball court being the canvas for his originals, signed with a flashing smile, a hanging tongue, and a powerful, twisting slam. Pistons coach Chuck Daly, a man who appreciated the arts, was not particularly enamored of Jordan's work, and after the 1988 game the Pistons instituted "the Jordan rules" and the campaign to allow what the Bulls believed was legalized assault on Michael Jordan.<br>The Pistons had two of the league's best man-to-man defenders, Joe Dumars and Dennis Rodman, to carry out those assignments. Jordan grudgingly respected Dumars, with whom he'd become somewhat friendly at the 1990 All-Star game; Dumars was quiet and resolute, a gentlemanly professional. But Jordan didn't care much for Rodman's play. "He's a flopper," Jordan would say disdainfully. "He just falls down and tries to get the calls. That's not good defense." Rodman once "flopped" so effectively back in the 1988-89 season that Jordan drew six fouls in the fourth quarter to foul out in the last minute of a close loss to the Pistons.<br>But Jordan's frustration against the Pistons was much larger than his dislike for Rodman, his team's lack of success against Detroit, or even his failure to score effectively since that Easter Sunday game. Detroit simply beat up Jordan, battering him through picks and screens whenever he tried to move. For Jordan, it was like trying to navigate a minefield of bullies. First he'd take a forearm shiver from Dumars when he tried to get past, then perhaps a bump from Bill Laimbeer and a bang from Rodman or Isiah Thomas. The Bulls were so concerned about some of these tactics a few years ago that they focused a camera on Laimbeer throughout the playoffs to see what he was doing and found that he was grabbing players at their pressure points to deaden their arms. They complained to the league but got no action. And while Thomas is not considered a good defender because he doesn't like to play a helping game, whenever the Bulls play Detroit he is quick to double-team Jordan. He knows Jordan despises him and doesn't care much for Jordan being the hero in Chicago, Isiah's hometown.<br>Jordan's resentment toward the angelic-looking Thomas is deep. Much of it stems from an alleged freeze-out of Jordan in the 1985 All-Star game, when Thomas and other players apparently conspired to keep Jordan from getting the ball -- and their paths have continued to cross along with their swords. During the 1989-90 season, Johnson suggested a one-on-one match between himself Jordan. Jordan wasn't too interested, but Johnson was looking at a big pay-per-view payoff and had already worked out a deal with a cable TV company. When word surfaced though, the NBA voiced its disapproval, and Thomas, head of the Players' Association, said it was not in the best interests of the players to have such unsanctioned off-season games. Suddenly Jordan was very interested. He said he always thought the Players' Association "was supposed to be for the players." And anyway, Jordan said, Thomas was just jealous. "He wasn't asked," snarled Jordan. "And do you want to know why? It's because if he were in it no one would be interested enough to watch."<br>But the Pistons get their shots back at Jordan. They love to taunt Jordan during games about his selfish play, his baldness (that's a specialty of John Salley), and how he enjoys being a loser. Salley, a bad stand-up comic who has earned a stage because he is seven feet tall and looks like Arsenio Hall, is a particularly bitter antagonist.<br>"There's not one guy who sets the tone on our team," Salley liked to tell reporters during the 1990 playoffs. "That's what makes us a team. If one guy did everything, we wouldn't be a team. We'd be the Chicago Bulls."<br>And this, too, from Salley: "We don't care who scores the points as long as we win. It would be hard for Michael Jordan to play on this team because he's got to score all the points. I don't think he'd fit in here."<br>Jordan burned over comments like that, but he seemed helpless to pay back the Pistons. Jordan was perhaps the league's best when angered, dunking over seven-footers after they'd blocked his shot, scoring wildly against boastful rookies, and surging to great heights when opponents scored on him regularly or tried to show him up, But Jordan couldn't make it happen against the Pistons, and his teammates were unable to ease the burden he felt.<br>In Game 1, John Paxson and Craig Hodges missed all 8 of their field-goal attempts and Scottie Pippen was thwarted by Rodman. "I seem to spend too much time worrying about how he's going to play me," Pippen would say later. Among Detroit starters, only Joe Dumars would score in double 27 points, but it would be enough.<br>In Game 2, Jordan limped on his injured hip and leg, and the Bulls fell. Pippen and Horace Grant scored 17 each, but it was hardly enough to make up for the ailing Jordan, who scored only 20. Dumars scored 31.<br>And so Jordan left the game without speaking to anyone, leaving the media scrambling for reasons and teammates searching for answers. It was not a happy group that headed back to Chicago for Game 3. Jordan believed his team had let him down when he was hurt. The team believed he'd let them down by failing to face the media after such a critical loss. Sure, several noted, he was there long into the night after he scored 50 points, but where was he when he scored only 20? And his man, Dumars, burned him in two straight games, and had clearly been the difference in Detroit's taking a 2-0 lead. The players agreed: We hear it from him when we don't play well, but when <i>he</i> doesn't play well it's still our fault?<br>Center Dave Corzine, a former Bull, had once explained it well: "It's hard playing on a team with Michael because you're always the reason the team lost." It certainly couldn't be Jordan's fault, everyone usually agreed; he was the best, wasn't he? There was not much anyone on the team could say publicly.<br>But Jordan would be ready for Game 3 back in the Stadium. He was angry and chastened, a little contrite perhaps, but also demanding payment for assorted sins.<br><br>Phil Jackson did the talking for the next few days following Tuesday's Game 2. Jordan, usually playful during practice, wasn't saying much. After practice Wednesday, with the media waiting and watching, most of the players skipped out the back door directly to the parking lot, which is what they always did when they wanted to avoid the press. But after complaints from the media, Jackson told Jordan he would have to go out the front door on Thursday -- to run the gauntlet, as the coaches liked to say, although the demands on Jordan from the local media (and the national media, too, for that matte...</p><h2>The Other Side of Silence : Bernie Gunther Thrille</h2><p>Other Side of Silence</p><p>Philip Kerr is the author of the internationally bestselling Bernie Gunther novels.

Elisabeth, my wife, left me a while ago and I&#x2019;d been missing her a lot. That was one source of pain, and a pretty major one, I have to admit. Even after a war in which more than four million German soldiers died, German wives are hard to come by. But another serious pain in my life was the war itself of course, and what happened to me back then, and in the Soviet POW camps afterwards. Which perhaps made my decision to commit suicide odd considering how hard it was not to die in Russia; but staying alive was always more of a habit for me than an active choice. For years under the Nazis I stayed alive out of sheer bloody mindedness. So I asked myself, early one Spring morning, why not kill yourself?&nbsp; To a Goethe-loving Prussian like me the pure reason of a question like that was almost unassailable. Besides, it wasn&#x2019;t as if life was so great anymore, although in truth I&#x2019;m not sure it ever was. Tomorrow and the long, long empty year to come after that isn&#x2019;t something of much interest to me, especially down here on the French Riviera. I was on my own, pushing sixty and working in a hotel job that I could do in my sleep, not that I got much of that these days. Most of the time I was miserable. I was living somewhere I didn&#x2019;t belong and it felt like a cold corner in hell, so it wasn&#x2019;t as if I believed anyone who enjoys a sunny day would miss the dark cloud that was my face.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was all that for choosing to die, plus the arrival of a guest at the hotel. A guest I recognized and wished I hadn&#x2019;t. But I&#x2019;ll come to him in a moment. Before that I have to explain why I&#x2019;m still here.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went into the garage underneath my small apartment in Villefranche, closed the door, and waited in the car with the engine turning over. Carbon monoxide poisoning isn&#x2019;t so bad. You just close your eyes and go to sleep. If the car hadn&#x2019;t stalled or perhaps just run out of gas I wouldn&#x2019;t be here now. I thought I might try it again another time, if things didn&#x2019;t improve and if I bought a more reliable motor car. On the other hand, I could have returned to Berlin, like my poor wife, which might have achieved the same result. Even today it&#x2019;s just as easy to get yourself killed there as it ever was and if I were to go back to the former German capital, I don&#x2019;t think it would be very long before someone was kind enough to organize my sudden death. One side or the other has got it in for me, and with good reason. When I was living in Berlin and being a cop or an ex-cop, I managed to offend almost everyone, with the possible exception of the British. Even so, I miss the city a lot. I miss the beer, of course, and the sausage. I miss being a cop when being Berlin police still meant something good. But mostly I miss the people who were as sour as I am. Even Germans don&#x2019;t like Berliners and it&#x2019;s a feeling that&#x2019;s usually reciprocated. Berliners don&#x2019;t like anyone very much - especially the women, which, somehow, only makes them more attractive to a dumb head like me. There&#x2019;s nothing more attractive to a man than a beautiful woman who really doesn&#x2019;t care if he lives or dies. I miss the women most of all. There were so many women. I think about the good women I&#x2019;ve known - quite a few of the bad ones, too - who I&#x2019;ll never see again and sometimes I start crying and from there it&#x2019;s only a short trip to the garage and asphyxiation, especially if I&#x2019;ve been drinking. Which, at home, is most of the time.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I&#x2019;m not feeling sorry for myself I play bridge, or read books about playing bridge, which might strike a lot of people as a pretty good reason on its own to kill yourself. But it&#x2019;s a game I find stimulating. Bridge helps to keep my mind sharp and occupied with something other than thoughts of home - and all those women, of course. In retrospect it seems that a great many of them must have been blondes and not just because they were German, or close to being German. Rather too late in life I&#x2019;ve learned that there&#x2019;s a type of woman I&#x2019;m attracted to, which is the wrong type, and it often happens that this includes a certain shade of hair color that just spells trouble for a man like me. Risky mate search and sexual cannibalism are a lot more common than you might think, although more usual among spiders. Apparently the females assess the nutritional value of a male rather than a male&#x2019;s value as a mate. Which more or less sums up the history of my entire personal life. I&#x2019;ve been eaten alive so many times I feel like I&#x2019;ve got eight legs, although by now it&#x2019;s probably just three or four.&nbsp; It&#x2019;s not much of an insight, I know, and like I say, it hardly matters now, but even if it happens late in life a degree of self-awareness has to be better than none at all. That&#x2019;s what my wife used to tell me, anyway.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Self-awareness certainly worked for her: she woke up one morning and realized just how bored and disappointed she was with me and our new life in France and went back home the very next day. I can&#x2019;t say that I blame her. She never managed to learn French, appreciate the food, or even enjoy the sun very much and that&#x2019;s the only thing down here of which there&#x2019;s a free and plentiful supply. At least in Berlin you always know why you&#x2019;re miserable. That&#x2019;s what Berlin<i> luft</i> is all about; an attempt to try to whistle your way out of the gloom. Here, on the Riviera, you would think there&#x2019;s everything to whistle about and no reason at all to be down in the mouth, but somehow I managed it and she couldn&#x2019;t take that anymore.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppose I was miserable largely because I&#x2019;m bored as hell. I miss my old detective&#x2019;s life. I&#x2019;d give anything to walk through the doors of the police praesidium on Alexanderplatz - by all accounts it&#x2019;s been demolished by the so-called East Germans, which is to say the communists - and to go upstairs to my desk in the Murder Commission. These days I&#x2019;m a concierge at the Grand Hotel in St. Jean Cap Ferrat. That&#x2019;s a little bit like being a policeman if your idea of being a policeman is directing traffic and I should know. It&#x2019;s exactly thirty-five years since I was first in uniform, on traffic duty at Potsdamer Platz. But I know the hotel business of old; for a while after the Nazis got into power I was the house detective at Berlin&#x2019;s famous Adlon Hotel. Being a concierge is very different to that. Mostly it&#x2019;s about making restaurant reservations, booking taxis and boats, coordinating porter service, shooing away prostitutes - which isn&#x2019;t as easy as it sounds; these days only American women can afford to look like prostitutes - and giving directions to witless tourists who can&#x2019;t read a map and don&#x2019;t speak French. Only very occasionally is there an unruly guest or a theft and I dream of having to assist the local Surï¿½te to solve a series of daring jewel robberies of the kind I saw in Alfred Hitchcock&#x2019;s <i>To Catch a Thief</i>. Of course, that&#x2019;s all it is; a dream. I wouldn&#x2019;t ever volunteer to help the local police, not because they&#x2019;re French - although that would be a good reason not to help them - but because I&#x2019;m living under a false passport, and not just any false passport, but one that was given to me by none other than Erich Mielke, who is currently the deputy head of the Stasi, the East German Security Police. That&#x2019;s the kind of favor that sometimes comes with a high price tag and, one day, I expect him to come calling to get me to pay it. Which will probably be the day when I have to go on my travels again. Compared to me, the Flying Dutchman was the Rock of Gibraltar. I suspect my wife knew this, since she also knew Mielke and better than me.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quite where I&#x2019;d go I have no idea although I hear North Africa is accommodating where Germans on a wanted list are concerned. There&#x2019;s a Fabre line boat that sails from Marseilles to Morocco every other day. That&#x2019;s just the sort of thing that a concierge is supposed to know although it&#x2019;s much more likely that there are rather more of the hotel&#x2019;s well-heeled guests who&#x2019;ve fled from Algeria than there are those who want to go there. Since the massacre of Pieds-Noirs civilians at Philippeville last year, the war against the FLN in Algiers isn&#x2019;t going so well for the French and by all accounts the colony is ruled even more harshly than it ever was when the Nazis left it to the tender mercies of the Vichy government.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#x2019;m not sure if the effortlessly handsome, dark-haired man I saw checking into one of the hotel&#x2019;s best suites the day before I tried to asphyxiate myself was on any kind of wanted list but he was certainly German and a criminal. Not that he looked like anything less affluent than a banker or a Hollywood film producer and he spoke such excellent French that it was probably only me who would have known he was German. He was using the name Harold Heinz Hebel and gave an address in Bonn, but his real name was Hennig, Harold Hennig and during the last few months of the war he&#x2019;d been a captain in the SD. Now in his early forties he wore a fine, gray lightweight suit that had been tailored for him and black, handmade shoes that were as shiny as a new centime. You tend to notice things like that when you&#x2019;re working at a place like the Grand Hotel. These days I can spot a Savile Row suit from the other side of the lobby. His manners were as smooth as the silk Hermï¿½s tie around his neck, which suited him better than the noose it richly deserved. He tipped all of the porters handsomely from a wad of new notes that was as thick as a slice of bread, and after that the boys treated him and his Louis Vuitton luggage with more care than a case of Meissen porcelain. Coincidentally, the last time I&#x2019;d seen him he&#x2019;d also had some expensive luggage with him, filled with valuables he and his boss, the East Prussian <i>Gauleiter</i> Erich Koch, had probably looted from the city. That had been in January 1945, sometime during the terrible Battle of Kï¿½nigsberg. He&#x2019;d been boarding the German passenger ship, <i>Wilhelm Gustloff </i>which was subsequently torpedoed by a Russian submarine with the loss of more than nine thousand civilian lives. He was one of the few rats that managed to escape from that particular sinking ship, which was a great pity since he&#x2019;d helped to bring about its destruction.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Harold Hennig recognized me he didn&#x2019;t show it. In our black morning coats, the hotel&#x2019;s desk staff all tend to look the same, of course. There&#x2019;s that and the fact that I&#x2019;m a little heavier now than I was back then, with less hair probably, not to mention a light tan that my wife used to say suited me. For a man who just tried to kill himself I&#x2019;m in remarkably good shape, even though I say so myself. Alice, one of the maids I&#x2019;ve taken a shine to since Elisabeth left, says I could easily pass for a man ten years younger. Which is just as well as I have a soul that feels like it&#x2019;s at least five hundred years old. It&#x2019;s looked into the abyss so many times it feels like Dante&#x2019;s walking stick.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harold Hennig looked straight at me, and although I didn&#x2019;t hold his gaze for more than a second or two, there was no need - being an ex-cop, I never forget a face, especially when it belongs to a mass-murderer. Nine thousand people - men and women and a great many children is a lot of reasons to remember a face like Harold Heinz Hennig&#x2019;s.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I have to admit that seeing him again looking so prosperous and in such rude health left me feeling very depressed. It&#x2019;s one thing to know that there are people like Eichmann and Mengele who got away with the most appalling crimes. It&#x2019;s another thing when several of the victims of a crime were your friends. There was a time when I might have tried to exact some kind of rough justice, but those days are long gone. These days, revenge is something of which my partner and I talk lightly at the end or perhaps the beginning of a game of bridge at La Voile d&#x2019;Or, which is the only other good hotel in Cap Ferrat. I don&#x2019;t even own a gun. If I did I certainly wouldn&#x2019;t be here now. I&#x2019;m a much better shot than I am a driver.</p></p><h2>Managers of Their Homes: A Practical Guide to Daily Scheduling for Christian Homeschool Families</h2><p>&#34;This book offers step-by-step instructions and a unique scheduling kit make the setting up of a daily schedule easily achievable for any homeschool family.

Al-Qaeda has morphed into a much more dangerous, menacing threat: ISIS. Lt. General Michael T. Flynn is blunt and urgent. This book aims to inform the American people of the grave danger we face in the war on terror?and will continue to face?until our government takes decisive action against the terrorists that want nothing more than to destroy us and our way of life. <br>Flynn spent more than thirty three years in Army intelligence, and as Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency worked closely with Generals Stanley McChrystal and David Petraeus, Admiral Mike Mullen, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and other policy, defense, intelligence, and war-fighting leaders. From coordinating on-the-ground operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, to building reliable intelligence networks, to preparing strategic plans for fighting terrorism, Flynn has been a firsthand witness to government screw-ups, smokescreens, and censored information that our leaders don&#x2019;t want us to know. <br><i>The Field of Fight</i> succinctly lays out why we have failed to stop terrorist groups from growing, and what we must do to stop them. The core message is that if you understand your enemies, it&#x2019;s a lot easier to defeat them?but because our government has concealed the actions of terrorists like Osama bin Laden and groups like ISIS and al Qaeda, and the role of Iran in the rise of radical Islam, we don&#x2019;t fully understand the enormity of the threat they pose against us.<br>A call to action that is sensible, informed, and original, <i>The Field of Fight</i> asserts that we must find a way to not only fight better, but to win.</p></p><p><p>Lt.

During the New Deal and World War II, Washington elites turned to Hope Ridings Miller&#x2019;s column in the Washington Post to see what was really going on in town. Cocktail parties, embassy receptions and formal dinners were her beat as society editor. &#x201c;I went as a guest,&#x201d; said Miller, &#x201c;and hoped that they&#x2019;d forget I was a reporter.&#x201d;<br><br>In Washington&#x2019;s Golden Age, Joseph Dalton chronicles the life of this pioneering woman journalist who covered the powerful vortex of politics, diplomacy, and society during a career that stretched from FDR to LBJ. After joining the Post staff, she was the only woman on the city desk. Later she had a nationally syndicated column. For ten years she edited Diplomat Magazine and then wrote three books about Washington life. Once a girl from a small town in Texas, Miller created a web of connections at the highest levels. In Washington&#x2019;s Golden Age, Dalton escorts readers inside the Capital&#x2019;s regal mansions, the hushed halls of Congress, and the Post&#x2019;s smoky and manly newsroom to rediscover an earlier era of gentility and discretion now relegated to the distant past.</p><p>Joseph Dalton has been a general arts reporter and music critic for the Times Union in Albany, NY since 2002.

In this meticulously researched book, Joseph Dalton traces his cousin&#x2019;s remarkable career as society editor for The Washington Post and observer of the power elite. Eleanor Roosevelt, Sam Rayburn, Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Mary Pickford, Walt Disney, Jacqueline Kennedy, Pat Nixon and even the Hope diamond all make appearances in Washington&#x2019;s Golden Age, but the real star is Miller, who not only documented a rarified world of high society and politics but lived it. Beyond the glittering social scenes, Dalton offers a glimpse of a time when women were just beginning to make their way in the newspaper business, when reporters and the people they covered were often allies, and when the rules of the game called for civility and manners &#x2013; and sometimes even white gloves.

In a world where economies as diverse as Ireland, Singapore and Dubai have tried to re-create the "Israel effect", there are entrepreneurial lessons well worth noting. As America reboots its own economy and can-do spirit, there's never been a better time to look at this remarkable and resilient nation for some impressive, surprising clues.</p><p>Dan Senor,<strong> </strong>Adjunct Senior Fellow for Middle East Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, has been on the front lines of policy, politics, and business in the Middle East.

What's your opinion on the meat shortage?"</i><br><i>The American says: What's a shortage?</i><br><i>The Russian says: What's meat?</i><br><i>The Chinese man says: What's an opinion?</i><br><i>The Israeli says: What's "Excuse me"?</i><br>-Mike Leigh, <i>Two Thousand Years</i><br><br>&nbsp;<br>Scott Thompson looked at his watch. He was running behind. He had a long list of to-dos to complete by the end of the week, and it was already Thursday. Thompson is a busy guy. As president and former chief technology officer of PayPal, the largest Internet payment system in the world, he runs the Web's alternative to checks and credit cards. But he'd promised to give twenty minutes to a kid who claimed to have a solution to the problem of online payment scams, credit card fraud, and electronic identity theft.<br><br>Shvat Shaked did not have the brashness of an entrepreneur, which was just as well, since most start-ups, Thompson knew, didn't go anywhere. He did not look like he had the moxie of even a typical PayPal junior engineer. But Thompson wasn't going to say no to this meeting, not when Benchmark Capital had requested it.<br><br>Benchmark had made a seed investment in eBay, back when it was being run out of the founders' apartment as a quirky exchange site for collectible Pez dispensers. Today, eBay is an $18 billion public company with sixteen thousand employees around the world. It's also PayPal's parent company. Benchmark was considering an investment in Shaked's company, Israel-based Fraud Sciences. To help with due diligence, the Benchmark partners asked Thompson, who knew a thing or two about e-fraud, to check Shaked out.<br><br>"So what's your model, Shvat?" Thompson asked, eager to get the meeting over with. Shifting around a bit like someone who hadn't quite perfected his one-minute "elevator pitch," Shaked began quietly: "Our idea is simple. We believe that the world is divided between good people and bad people, and the trick to beating fraud is to distinguish between them on the Web."<br><br>Thompson suppressed his frustration. This was too much, even as a favor to Benchmark. Before PayPal, Thompson had been a top executive at credit card giant Visa, an even bigger company that was no less obsessed with combating fraud. A large part of the team at most credit card companies and online vendors is devoted to vetting new customers and fighting fraud and identity theft, because that's where profit margins can be largely determined and where customer trust is built or lost.<br><br>Visa and the banks it partnered with together had tens of thousands of people working to beat fraud. PayPal had two thousand, including some fifty of their best PhD engineers, trying to stay ahead of the crooks. And this kid was talking about "good guys and bad guys," as if he were the first to discover the problem.<br><br>"Sounds good," Thompson said, not without restraint. "How do you do that?"<br><br>"Good people leave traces of themselves on the Internet-digital footprints-because they have nothing to hide," Shvat continued in his accented English. "Bad people don't, because they try to hide themselves. All we do is look for footprints. If you can find them, you can minimize risk to an acceptable level and underwrite it. It really is that simple."<br><br>Thompson was beginning to think that this guy with the strange name had flown in not from a different country but rather a different planet. Didn't he know that fighting fraud is a painstaking process of checking backgrounds, wading through credit histories, building sophisticated algorithms to determine trustworthiness? You wouldn't walk into NASA and say, "Why build all those fancy spaceships when all you need is a slingshot?"<br><br>Still, out of respect for Benchmark, Thompson thought he'd indulge Shaked for a few more minutes. "So where did you learn how to do this?" he asked.<br><br>"Hunting down terrorists," Shaked said matter-of-factly. His unit in the army had been tasked with helping to catch terrorists by tracking their online activities. Terrorists move money through the Web with fictitious identities. Shvat's job was to find them online.<br><br>Thompson had heard enough from this "terrorist hunter," too much even, but he had a simple way out. "Have you tried this at all?" he asked.<br><br>"Yes," Shaked said with quiet self-assurance. "We've tried it on thousands of transactions, and we were right about all of them but four."<br><br><i>Yeah, right </i>, Thompson thought to himself. But he couldn't help becoming a bit more curious. How long did that take? he asked.<br><br>Shaked said his company had analyzed forty thousand transactions over five years, since its founding.<br><br>"Okay, so here's what we're going to do," Thompson said, and he proposed that he give Fraud Sciences one hundred thousand PayPal transactions to analyze. These were consumer transactions PayPal had already processed. PayPal would have to scrub some of the personal data for legal privacy reasons, which would make Shvat's job more difficult. "But see what you can do," Thompson offered, "and get back to us. We'll compare your results with ours."<br><br>Since it had taken Shvat's start-up five years to go through their first forty thousand transactions, Thompson figured he wouldn't be seeing the kid again anytime soon. But he wasn't asking anything unfair. This was the sort of scaling necessary to determine whether his bizarre-sounding system was worth anything in the real world.<br><br>The forty thousand transactions Fraud Sciences had previously processed had been done manually. Shaked knew that to meet PayPal's challenge he would have to automate his system in order to handle the volume, do so without compromising reliability, and crunch the transactions in record time. This would mean taking the system he'd tested over five years and turning it upside down, quickly.<br><br>Thompson gave the transaction data to Shvat on a Thursday. "I figured I was off the hook with Benchmark," he recalled. "We'd never hear from Shvat again. Or at least not for months." So he was surprised when he received an e-mail from Israel on Sunday. It said, "We're done."<br><br>Thompson didn't believe it. First thing Monday morning, he handed Fraud Sciences' work over to his team of PhDs for analysis; it took them a week to match the results up against PayPal's. But by Wednesday, Thompson's engineers were amazed at what they had seen so far. Shaked and his small team produced more accurate results than PayPal had, in a shorter amount of time, and with incomplete data. The difference was particularly pronounced on the transactions that had given PayPal the most trouble-on these, Fraud Sciences had performed 17 percent better. This was the category of customer applicants, Thompson told us, that PayPal initially rejected. But in light of what PayPal now knows from monitoring the rejected customers' more recent credit reports, Thompson said, those rejections were a mistake: "They are good customers. We should never have rejected them. They slipped through our system. But how did they <i>not </i>slip through Shaked's system?"<br><br>Thompson realized that he was looking at a truly original tool against fraud. With even less data than PayPal had, Fraud Sciences was able to more accurately predict who would turn out to be a good customer and who would not. "I was sitting here, dumbfounded," Thompson recalled. "I didn't get it. We're the best in the business at risk management. How is it that this fifty-five-person company from Israel, with a crackpot theory about 'good guys' and 'bad guys,' managed to beat us?" Thompson estimated that Fraud Sciences was five years ahead of PayPal in the effectiveness of its system. His previous company, Visa, would never have been able to come up with such thinking, even if given ten or fifteen years to work on it.<br><br>Thompson knew what he had to tell Benchmark: PayPal could not afford to risk letting its competitors get hold of Fraud Sciences' breakthrough technology. This was not a company Benchmark should invest in; PayPal needed to acquire the company.<br><br>Immediately.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Thompson went to eBay's CEO , Meg Whitman, to bring her into the loop. "I told Scott that it was impossible," Whitman related. "We're the market leader. Where on earth did this tiny little company come from?" Thompson and his team of PhDs walked her through the results. She was astounded.<br><br>Now Thompson and Whitman had a truly unexpected problem on their hands. What could they tell Shvat? If Thompson told this start-up's CEO that he had handily beaten the industry leader, the start-up's team would realize they were sitting on something invaluable. Thompson knew that PayPal had to buy Fraud Sciences, but how could he tell Shvat the test results without jacking up the company's price and negotiating position?<br><br>So he stalled. He responded to Shaked's anxious e-mails by saying PayPal needed more time for analysis. Finally, he said he would share the results in person the next time the Fraud Sciences team was in San Jose, hoping to buy more time. Within a day or two, Shaked was on Thompson's doorstep.<br><br>What Thompson did not know, however, was that the Fraud Sciences founders-Shaked and Saar Wilf, who served together in Israel's elite army intelligence unit, called 8200-were not interested in selling their company to PayPal. They just wanted Thompson's blessing as they proceeded down a checklist of due diligence requirements for Benchmark Capital.<br><br>Thompson went back to Meg: "We need to make a decision. They're here." She gave him the go-ahead: "Let's buy it." After some valuation work, they offered $79 million. Shaked declined. The Fraud Sciences board, which included the Israeli venture firm BRM Capital, believed the company was worth at least $200 million.<br><br>Eli Barkat, one of the founding partners of BRM , explained to us his theory behind the company's future value: "The first generation of technology security was protecting against a virus invading your PC. The second generation was building a firewall against hackers." Barkat knew something about both these threats, having funded and built companies to protect against them. One of them, Checkpoint-an Israeli company also started by young alumni from Unit 8200-is worth $5 billion today, is publicly traded on the NASDAQ, and includes among its customers the majority of Fortune 100 companies and most national governments around the world. The third generation of security would be protecting against hacking into e-commerce activity. "And this would be the biggest market yet," Barkat told us, "because up until then, hackers were just having fun-it was a hobby. But with e-commerce taking off, hackers could make real money."<br><br>Barkat also believed that Fraud Sciences had the best team and the best technology to defend against Internet and credit card fraud. "You've got to understand the Israeli mentality," he said. "When you've been developing technology to find terrorists-when lots of innocent lives hang in the balance-then finding thieves is pretty simple."<br><br>After negotiations that lasted only a few days, Thompson and Shaked agreed on $169 million. Thompson told us that the PayPal team thought it could get away with a lower price. When the negotiating process began and Shaked stuck to the higher number, Thompson assumed it was just a bluff. "I figured I'd never seen such a convincing poker face. But what was really going on was that the Fraud Sciences guys had a view of what their company was worth. They were not sales guys. They weren't hyping it. Shaked just played it straight. He basically said to us, 'This is our solution. We know it is the best. This is what we think it's worth.' And that really was the end of it. There was a matter-of-factness that you just don't see that often."<br><br>Soon after, Thompson was on a plane to visit the company he had just purchased. During the last leg of the twenty-hour flight from San Francisco, about forty-five minutes before landing, as he sipped his coffee to wake up, he happened to glance at the screen in the aisle that showed the plane's trajectory on a map. He could see the little airplane icon at the end of its flight path, about to land in Tel Aviv. That was fine, until he noticed what else was on the map, which at this point showed only places that were pretty close by. He could see the names and capitals of the countries in the region, arrayed in a ring around Israel: Beirut, Lebanon; Damascus, Syria; Amman, Jordan; and Cairo, Egypt. For a moment, he panicked: "I bought a company there? I'm flying into a war zone!" Of course, he'd known all along who Israel's neighbors were, but it had not quite sunk in how small Israel was and how closely those neighbors ringed it. "It was as if I were flying into New York and suddenly saw Iran where New Jersey was supposed to be," he recalled.<br><br>It didn't take long after he stepped off the plane, however, before he was at ease in a place that was not shockingly unfamiliar, and that treated him to some pleasant surprises. His first big impression was in the Fraud Sciences parking lot. Every car had a PayPal bumper sticker on it. "You'd never see that kind of pride or enthusiasm at an American company," he told us.<br><br>The next thing that struck Thompson was the demeanor of the Fraud Sciences employees during the all-hands meeting at which he spoke. Each face was turned raptly to him. No one was texting, surfing, or dozing off. The intensity only increased when he opened the discussion period: "Every question was penetrating. I actually started to get nervous up there. I'd never before heard so many unconventional observations-one after the other. And these weren't peers or supervisors, these were junior employees. And they had no inhibition about challenging the logic behind the way we at PayPal had been doing things for years. I'd never seen this kind of completely unvarnished, unintimidated, and undistracted attitude. I found myself thinking, Who works for whom?"<br><br>What Scott Thompson was experiencing was his first dose of Israeli <i>chutzpah</i>. According to Jewish scholar Leo Rosten's description of Yiddish-the all-but-vanished German-Slavic language from which modern Hebrew borrowed the word- <i>chutzpah </i>is "gall, brazen nerve, effrontery, incredible 'guts,' presumption plus arrogance such as no other word and no other language can do justice to." An outsider would see <i>chutzpah </i>everywhere in Israel: in the way university students speak with their professors, employees challenge their bosses, sergeants question their generals, and clerks second-guess government ministers. To Israelis, however, this isn't <i>chutzpah </i>, it's the normal mode of being. Somewhere along the way-either at home, in school, or in the army-Israelis learn that assertiveness is the norm, reticence something that risks your being left behind.<br><br>This is evident even in popular forms of address in Israel.

In telling Gravano&#39;s story, Peter Maas brings us as never before into the innermost sanctums of the Cosa Nostra as if we were there ourselves--a secret underworld of power, lust, greed, betrayal, and deception, with the specter of violent death always waiting in the wings.</p><p>America's fascination with organized crime is bottomless. From the books of Mario Puzo's Godfather series to films like <i>Good Fellas,</i> popular culture feeds an appetite for the dark side of the American dream--fortunes built on drugs, prostitution, and gambling instead of steel, railways, and software. But even in the most brutal films or books, a certain patina of glamour clings to fictional mobsters; their antihero status renders them strangely seductive. Now comes a real-life account of the mob by one of its former leading denizens: <i>Underboss</i>, the story of Sammy "the Bull" Gravano, as told by Peter Maas. Gravano spent his entire life in the mob, his loyalty unswerving until the moment he realized crime boss John Gotti was about to sell him down the river in order to save his own neck. At that point Sammy the Bull "switched governments" and turned state's evidence. <p> Gravano might not be well-educated and he's certainly not glamorous, but he's a vivid storyteller. What he has to say is horrifying in its matter-of-factness. Car thief, extortionist, intimidator, and murderer, Gravano was also a dedicated family man who preferred to spend evenings home with his wife and kids. Above all, he never lost sight of who and what he was: "I don't think I'm Robin Hood. I think I'm a gangster." John Gotti, on the other hand, thought he was a celebrity, an attitude Gravano obviously disapproved of. The relationship between Gotti and Gravano lies at the heart of this story, for loyalty is what Gravano lived by and what he ultimately betrayed. His reasons make for compelling, disturbing reading.</p>In March of 1992, the highest-ranking member of the Mafia in America ever to defect broke his blood oath of silence and testified against his boss, John Gotti. He is Salvatore (Sammy the Bull) Gravano, second-in-command of the Gambino organized-crime family, the most powerful in the nation. Today, Gotti is serving life in prison without parole. And as a direct consequence of Gravano&#39;s testimony, Cosa Nostra - the Mafia&#39;s true name - is in shambles. In Underboss, based on dozens of hours of interviews with Gravano, much of it written in Sammy the Bull&#39;s own voice, we are ushered as never before into the uppermost secret inner sanctums of Cosa Nostra - an underworld of power, lust, greed, betrayal, deception, sometimes even honor, with the specter of violent death always poised in the wings. Gravano&#39;s is a story about starting out on the street, about killing and being killed, revealing the truth behind a quarter-century of shocking headlines. It is also a tragic story of a wasted life, of unalterable choices and the web of lies, weakness, and treachery that underlie the so-called Honored Society.</p><h2>Wild Rescuers: Escape to the Mesa (Wild Rescuers, 2)</h2><p><p><strong>The next installment in the <em>New York Times </em>bestselling series! </strong></p><p><strong>From YouTube gamer StacyPlays comes the exhilarating sequel to her Minecraft-inspired adventure novel about a girl raised by wolves. </strong></p><p>Stacy would do anything to protect the Taiga where she lives with the pack of intelligent wolves who raised her.

Alison shook her head. The sheep had gotten loose and gone straight for the water. Again.<br><br>She crossed her arms and watched their fuzzy square heads appearing and disappearing in the water, showing no sign that they were considering coming to dry land anytime soon. What was with these sheep? They wanted to be in the water more than any sheep she&#x2019;d ever known. Her parents had bred the animals for their coloring, but as far as she knew, they hadn&#x2019;t tried to crossbreed with squid.<br><br>Speaking of squid: from the dark smudges in the water, the sheep had attracted some friends.<br><br>The sun hung high in the sky, so Alison had time to wade in and get them, but she hated swimming after the little monsters. Wet wool was the worst smell.<br><br>&#x201c;Fantastic,&#x201d; she muttered, pushing her sleeves up. She pulled some wheat from her pack and walked to the edge of the cove.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d; came a voice over her shoulder.<br><br>She jumped and whirled. Her best friend stood behind her, head cocked. &#x201c;Max!&#x201d; she shouted. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do that. I thought you were a creeper!&#x201d;<br><br>He shrugged. &#x201c;Was I hissing? I just wanted to know what you were up to.&#x201d; He leaned to look around her. &#x201c;Oh . . . sheep swimming again?&#x201d;<br><br>She was torn between pointing out the stupidly obvious and telling him to get away from the water. She decided on both. &#x201c;Apple and Lil&#x2019; Prince got out again. I&#x2019;m getting them back&#x201d;&#x2014;Max opened his mouth, but she continued, hurriedly&#x2014;&#x201c;alone, Max. Your mom will kill you if you go near the water again. And then she&#x2019;ll kill me twice.&#x201d;<br><br>He looked around with exaggerated focus, shielding his eyes from the sun with his hand. &#x201c;Hm. I don&#x2019;t see her anywhere. And I&#x2019;m already near the water.&#x201d; He edged closer and dipped his toes in, eyes squeezed shut. Then he opened them. &#x201c;Did I die?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not yet,&#x201d; Alison said through gritted teeth. &#x201c;Just let me get them out of there. If you want to help, go check their pen or something. Figure out why they got out again.&#x201d;<br><br>Max took another step into the water, watching the animals splash around. Alison had to admit, the sheep did look like they were having the time of their lives in the cove. A squid had definitely joined them, its tentacles waving in and out of the water alongside the sheep&#x2019;s brightly colored heads.<br><br>&#x201c;You know they like me better than you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You need my help.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That makes no difference, they&#x2019;ll come if I&#x2019;ve got food,&#x201d; Alison said, exasperated. &#x201c;And no, they don&#x2019;t like you better.&#x201d;<br><br>But they did. It really annoyed her that the red and orange line of her family&#x2019;s flock liked her best friend and ignored her. Today was no different; they must&#x2019;ve thought Max was coming to play with them, because the moment he was up to his knees in the water they bleated happily and began to swim toward him.<br><br>He hadn&#x2019;t even tried to get their attention with wheat.<br><br>&#x201c;Max!&#x201d; came a loud shout, and Alison winced. She didn&#x2019;t turn around. She knew that sound very well; Max&#x2019;s mom made it all the time. &#x201c;Get out of the water right now!&#x201d;<br><br>She brushed by Alison without a word and ran into the water. Apple and Lil&#x2019; Prince bleated in panic and turned to escape, eager to get away from the rampaging, splashing monster that bore down on Max. The squid dove into the deep.<br><br>Max&#x2019;s mom paid no attention. Max had barely begun to protest when his mom grabbed him around the middle and muscled him back toward the beach.<br><br>Max struggled. &#x201c;Mom, it&#x2019;s okay, I&#x2019;m not drowning, I wasn&#x2019;t going any deeper!&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;Alison needed help with the sheep!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I will not risk losing you again!&#x201d; his mom said, tears already forming in her furious eyes. She dumped him on the sand and put her hands on her hips.<br><br>&#x201c;You won&#x2019;t lose me!&#x201d; Max said, but his last words were cut off with a grunt when his mom bent over suddenly and grabbed him again, wrapping him in a tight hug.<br><br>&#x201c;Did you forget I almost lost you already?&#x201d; she repeated, ignoring his struggles.<br><br>Alison looked away, embarrassed. In recent months, seeing others&#x2019; family closeness, even the weird closeness Max had with his overprotective family, made her uncomfortable.<br><br>&#x201c;And Alison,&#x201d; Max&#x2019;s mom said, letting her son go and putting her hands on her hips again. &#x201c;I thought you knew better.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t yell at Ali, Mom,&#x201d; Max said, stepping between them. &#x201c;She told me not to go. I didn&#x2019;t listen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She should still take care of you. She&#x2019;s older.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;By less than a year!&#x201d; Max protested. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m twelve, I don&#x2019;t need her to be my babysitter.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We will talk about this at dinner, you two,&#x201d; she said, then pointed at Max. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t go into the water again.&#x201d;<br><br>Max sighed. &#x201c;Yeah, okay. I&#x2019;ll go check the pens, Ali, and be really careful not to go near any water on the way. I don&#x2019;t know what I&#x2019;ll do about my spit, though. It&#x2019;s pretty hard to avoid.&#x201d; He spat on the ground and then sprinted away from it, arms flailing in mock panic.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not funny!&#x201d; Max&#x2019;s mother called as she watched him go, tears dribbling down her face. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want him near the water,&#x201d; she reminded Alison&#x2014;as if she&#x2019;d forgotten.<br><br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Alison said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to be near the water either. But the pen broke again, and I had to get the sheep back.&#x201d;<br><br>Max&#x2019;s mom wiped her cheeks and took a deep breath. Composed, she looked at Alison, pity in her swollen eyes. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; she asked gently.<br><br>&#x201c;Why what? Why do I need them back? Because they got out,&#x201d; Alison said, blinking at her. &#x201c;Why did the pen break? I don&#x2019;t know. But I do know the sheep get out, and when that happens, you put them back in. My grandfather had a stupid saying about it, something like &#x2018;When the sheep get out, might as well raise mooshrooms.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Max&#x2019;s mom frowned. &#x201c;That makes no sense. I meant why worry about the sheep? They&#x2019;d do fine if you let them go wild. You don&#x2019;t need to care for them anymore. We don&#x2019;t need the wool, you don&#x2019;t need the responsibility. There&#x2019;s definitely no reason to keep breeding them, and fixing the pen just takes you back to your house over and over again. You could do without the memories, you know.&#x201d; She put a little emphasis on over and over, reminding Alison that going back to her destroyed house wasn&#x2019;t doing her any good. She patted Alison on the shoulder. &#x201c;Think about it. I&#x2019;ll see you at dinner.&#x201d;<br><br>Alison stared into the water to avoid watching her go. The pen had been a ways from the house, through a copse of trees, so when she visited the sheep she didn&#x2019;t actually see the ruined tree house that she used to call home.<br><br>She visited the pen often, trying to be responsible for the sheep. She felt she owed them that much.<br><br>But Max&#x2019;s mom was right. They didn&#x2019;t need the wool anymore. And Alison was wasting time and materials with frequent repairs on the pens, and losing whole afternoons running after the lost flock.<br><br>Then again, they were one of the few sources of joy in her life. She gazed out at the swimming sheep, who happily played with the squid, which had resurfaced and was playfully wrapping its tentacles around Apple. Lil&#x2019; Prince was trying to head-butt the tentacles that got near him.<br><br>Alison heard thumping steps behind her and, before she could turn around, Max was back, running past her toward the cove. With a whoop he jumped into the shallow water, making the biggest splash he possibly could have, and waded with high, galumphing steps toward the sheep, who greeted him with happy bleats.<br><br>Alison laughed and waded out after him, waving the wheat over her head. Even with the threat of getting in trouble hanging over them, Max could always make her laugh and forget about her problems for a moment.</p><h2>The Power of Praying Through Fear Book of Prayers</h2><p><p><b>There Are Many Reasons to Have Fear,<br> But God Can Conquer Them All</b></p><p> Find the peace you long for amid the things that frighten you with the help of this collection of prayers from Stormie Omartian.

Born in Ames, Iowa, Peirce grew up in Durham, New Hampshire. As a kid, he began creating his own strips in the sixth grade. Peirce taught high school in New York City and has created several animated pilots for Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon. He lives in Portland, Maine, with his family.Gr 4&#x2013;6&#x2014;Heads up&#x2014;Big Nate's hockey puck and paper airplanes coming though! Big Nate continues his wily evasion of homework and navigations of middle school social scenes in this latest addition to the series. In the tradition of classic funny strips, a thin thread of a plot with some gags in the middle are communicated via four to eight panels, each with a small resolution. This volume has Nate working to join Marcus's cool kid group, which results in running lots of errands for the big kids and rejecting old friends until he learns his lesson. Big Nate walks a fine line between tired tropes and alternative representations: there's everything from a single dad to an assertive (and therefore abhorrent) fat girl who wants to date Nate against his will. The line drawings are generally clear and effective, but the choice to depict Ms. Clarke's brown skin with stripes all over her face is odd. Peirce's representations of Spitsy the deranged dog are laugh-out-loud funny. Though it stands alone just fine, it's the rabid Big Nate fans who will clamor for this one.

She undertakes this spiritual and psychological journey to become whole, integrating all parts of her nature. Sometimes the journey is conscious, but in many cases it is not. Drawing upon cultural myths and fairy tales, ancient symbols and goddesses, and the dreams of contemporary women, Murdock illustrates the need for&#x2014;and the reality of&#x2014;feminine values in Western culture today.</p><p>Maureen Murdock is a licensed family therapist in private practice in Venice, California, and teaches in the UCLA Extension Writer's Program. She is also the internationally published author of <i>The Heroine's Journey, Spinning Inward, </i>and<i> Fathers' Daughters. </i> <i>The Heroine's Journey Workbook </i> grew out of her work with women in therapy and workshops conducted throughout North America over the past twenty years."Though the book is rich with examples drawn from myths and Jungian psychology, it is surprisingly easy to read. The journey requires serious, often frightening, wandering before one's true identity and power are known. Like the journey Murdock describes, there are no cheap, easy lessons. There are many rich, rewarding lessons, but these are gained only through integrity, courage, and the willingness to meet challenge with all the resources one can muster."&#x2014;<i>Creation</i><br>"Murdock's personal journey will surely speak to many women, but I hope also to those men willing to hear these newly awakened female voices&#x2014;and of the feminine in their own souls."&#x2014;<i>Utne Reader</i><br>"Combining personal experience and painstaking erudition, Maureen Murdock's <i>The Heroine's Journey </i>shares with us the essence of the female journey.

Murdock writes in a clear and compassionate voice which draws inspiration from her experiences as a mother, artist, and therapist and from the collective wisdom of the community of women on the path of the goddess. This book speaks to each woman who longs for a spiritually alive feminine self, one who is actively engaged in the world, and who embraces the masculine principle as a mirror of herself. <i>The Heroine's Journey </i>guides the reader in reweaving the threads of her life story into a mantle of empowerment for herself, for other women, and for Gaia, the Planet Herself."&#x2014;Patrice Wynne, author of <i>The Womanspirit Sourcebook </i>and co-founder of the Gaia Bookstore and Catalogue Company<br>"Maureen Murdock's important book on the heroine's journey contains a wealth of insight that is of great value to contemporary Western women.

And so perhaps it was inevitable that he would become a spy. . . .<br><br>Malcolm's parents run an inn called the Trout, on the banks of the river Thames, and all of Oxford passes through its doors. Malcolm and his daemon, Asta, routinely overhear news and gossip, and the occasional scandal, but during a winter of unceasing rain, Malcolm catches wind of something new: intrigue.&nbsp;<br><br>He finds a secret message inquiring about a dangerous substance called Dust&#x2014;and the spy it was intended for finds <i>him.</i>&nbsp;<br><br>When she asks Malcolm to keep his eyes open, he sees suspicious characters everywhere: the explorer Lord Asriel, clearly on the run; enforcement agents from the Magisterium; a gyptian named Coram with warnings just for Malcolm; and a beautiful woman with an evil monkey for a daemon. All are asking about the same thing: a girl&#x2014;just a baby&#x2014;named Lyra.<br><br>Lyra is the kind of person who draws people in like magnets. And Malcolm will brave any danger, and make shocking sacrifices, to bring her safely through the storm.<br><br>Don't miss the second volume, <i>The Secret Commonwealth</i>!<br><br><b><b>"Too few things in our world are worth a seventeen-year wait:&nbsp;<i>The Book of Dus</i>t is one of them." &#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i></b></b><br><br><b><b>"The book is full of wonder. . . .

One night his father comes to Malcolm&#x2019;s bedroom.</i><br> &#x201c;Malcolm, you en&#x2019;t in bed yet&#x2014;good. Come downstairs for a minute. There&#x2019;s a gentleman wants a word with you.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Who is it?&#x201d; said Malcolm eagerly, jumping up and following his father out.<br><br> &#x201c;Keep your voice down. He&#x2019;ll tell you who he is if he wants to.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Where is he?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;In the Terrace Room. Take him a glass of Tokay.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Hungarian wine. Come on, hurry up. Mind your manners and tell the truth.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I always do,&#x201d; said Malcolm automatically.<br><br> &#x201c;News to me,&#x201d; said his father. But he ruffled Malcolm&#x2019;s hair before they entered the bar.<br><br> The gentleman waiting gave him a start, though all he was doing was sitting still by the cold fireplace. Perhaps it was his dï¿½mon, a beautiful silvery spotted leopard, or perhaps it was his dark, saturnine expression; in any event, Malcolm felt daunted, and very young and small. His dï¿½mon, Asta, became a moth.<br><br> &#x201c;Good evening, sir,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Your Tokay what you ordered. Would you like me to make up the fire? It&#x2019;s ever so cold in here.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Is your name Malcolm?&#x201d; The man&#x2019;s voice was harsh and deep.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, sir. Malcolm Polstead.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a friend of Dr. Relf,&#x201d; said the man. &#x201c;My name is Asriel.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh. Er&#x2014;she hasn&#x2019;t told me about you,&#x201d; Malcolm said.<br><br> &#x201c;Why did you say that?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Because if she had, I&#x2019;d know it was true.&#x201d;<br><br> Asriel gave a short laugh.<br><br> &#x201c;I understand,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You want another reference? I&#x2019;m the father of that baby in the priory.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh! You&#x2019;re <i>Lord </i>Asriel!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. But how are you going to test the truth of that claim?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the baby&#x2019;s name?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Lyra.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;And what&#x2019;s her dï¿½mon called?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Pantalaimon.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;All right,&#x201d; said Malcolm.<br><br> &#x201c;All right now? You sure?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No, I en&#x2019;t <i>sure.</i> But I&#x2019;m more sure than I was.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Good. Can you tell me what happened earlier this evening?&#x201d;<br><br> Malcolm went through it as fully as he could remember.<br><br> &#x201c;These men came from the Office of Child Protection, and they wanted to take her away. Take Lyra. But Sister Benedicta wouldn&#x2019;t let &#x2019;em.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What did they look like?&#x201d;<br><br> Malcolm described their uniforms. &#x201c;The one who took his cap off, he seemed like he was in charge. He was more polite than the others, more sort of smooth and smiling. But it was a real smile, not a fake one. I think I&#x2019;d even&#x2019;ve liked him if he&#x2019;d come in here as a customer&#x2014;that sort of thing. The other two were just dull and threatening. Most people would&#x2019;ve been dead scared, but Sister Benedicta wasn&#x2019;t. She faced &#x2019;em off all by herself.&#x201d;<br><br> The man sipped his Tokay. His dï¿½mon lay with her head up and her front paws stretched out ahead of her, like the picture of the Sphinx in Malcolm&#x2019;s encyclopedia. The black-and-silver patterns on her back seemed to flicker and shimmer for a moment, and then Lord Asriel spoke suddenly.<br><br> &#x201c;Do you know why I haven&#x2019;t been to see my daughter?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I thought you were busy. You probably had important things to do.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t been to see her because if I do, she&#x2019;ll be taken away from there and put in a much less congenial place. There&#x2019;ll be no Sister Benedicta to stand up for her there. But now they&#x2019;re trying to take her anyway. . . .&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Excuse me, sir, but I told Dr. Relf about all this. Didn&#x2019;t she tell you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Still not quite sure about me?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Well . . . no,&#x201d; said Malcolm.<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t blame you. You going to go on visiting Dr. Relf?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes. Because she lends me books as well as listening to what&#x2019;s happened.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Does she? Good for her. But tell me, the baby&#x2014;is she being well looked after?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, yes. Sister Fenella, she loves her a lot. We all&#x2014; They all do. She&#x2019;s very happy&#x2014;Lyra, I mean. She talks to her dï¿½mon all the time, just jabber jabber jabber, and he jabbers back. Sister Fenella says they&#x2019;re teaching each other to talk.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Does she eat properly? Does she laugh? Is she active and curious?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, yeah. The nuns are really good to her.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But now they&#x2019;re being threatened. . . .&#x201d;<br><br> Asriel got up and went to the window to look at the few lights from the priory across the river.<br><br> &#x201c;Seems like it, sir. I mean, Your Lordship.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;&#x2018;Sir&#x2019; will do. You know them well, these nuns?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve known &#x2019;em all my life, sir.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;And they&#x2019;d listen to you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I suppose they would, yes.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Could you tell them I&#x2019;m here and I&#x2019;d like to see my daughter?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;When?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Right now. I&#x2019;m being pursued. The High Court has ordered me not to go within fifty miles of her, and if I&#x2019;m found here, they&#x2019;ll take her away and put her somewhere else where they aren&#x2019;t so careful.&#x201d;<br><br> Malcolm was torn between saying, &#x201c;Well, you ought not to risk it, then,&#x201d; and simple admiration and understanding: of course the man would want to see his daughter, and it was wicked to try to prevent him.<br><br> &#x201c;Well . . .&#x201d; Malcolm thought, then said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think you could see her right now, sir. They go to bed ever so early. I wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised if they were all fast asleep. In the morning they get up ever so early too. Maybe&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t got that long. Which room have they made into a nursery?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Round the other side, sir, facing the orchard.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Which floor?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;All their bedrooms are on the ground floor, and hers is too.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;And you know which one?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, I do, but&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You could show me, then. Come on.&#x201d;<br><br> There was no refusing this man. Malcolm led him out of the Terrace Room and along the corridor, and out onto the terrace before his father could see them. He closed the door very quietly behind them and found the garden brilliantly lit by the clearest full moon there&#x2019;d been for months. It felt as if they were being lit by a floodlight.<br><br> &#x201c;Did you say there was someone pursuing you?&#x201d; said Malcolm quietly.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes. There&#x2019;s someone watching the bridge. Is there any other way across the river?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s my canoe. It&#x2019;s down this way, sir. Let&#x2019;s get off the terrace before anyone sees us.&#x201d;<br><br> Lord Asriel went beside him across the grass and into the lean-to where the canoe was kept.<br><br> &#x201c;Ah, it&#x2019;s a proper canoe,&#x201d; said Lord Asriel, as if he&#x2019;d been expecting a toy. Malcolm felt a little affronted on behalf of La Belle Sauvage and said nothing as he turned her over and let her slip quietly down the grass and onto the water.<br> &#x201c;First thing,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;is we&#x2019;ll go downstream a short way, so&#x2019;s no one can see us from the bridge. There&#x2019;s a way into the priory garden on that side. You get in first, sir.&#x201d;<br><br> Asriel did so, much more capably than Malcolm had anticipated and his leopard daemon followed, with no more weight than a shadow. The canoe hardly moved at all, and Asriel sat down lightly and kept still as Malcolm got in after him.<br><br> &#x201c;You been in a canoe before,&#x201d; Malcolm whispered.<br><br> &#x201c;Yes. This is a good one.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Quiet, now . . .&#x201d;<br><br> Malcolm pushed off and began to paddle, staying close to the bank under the trees and making no noise at all. If there was one thing he was good at, this was it. Once they were out of sight of the bridge, he turned the boat to starboard and made for the other shore.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to come up alongside a willow stump,&#x201d; he said very quietly. &#x201c;The grass is thick there. We&#x2019;ll tie her up and go back across the field, behind the hedge.&#x201d;<br><br> Lord Asriel was just as good at getting out as he&#x2019;d been at getting in. Malcolm couldn&#x2019;t imagine a better passenger. He tied the boat to a stout willow branch growing from the stump, and a few seconds later they were moving along the edge of the meadow, under the shade of the hedge.<br><br> Malcolm found the gap he knew about and forced his way through the brambles. It must have been harder for the man, being bigger, but he didn&#x2019;t say a word. They were in the priory orchard; the lines of plum trees and apple trees, of pear trees and damson trees, stood bare and neat and fast asleep under the moon.<br><br> Malcolm led the way around the back of the priory and came to the side where the window of Lyra&#x2019;s nursery would be, if it hadn&#x2019;t been hidden by the new shutters. They did look remarkably solid.<br><br> He counted once more to make sure it was the right one, and then tapped quietly on the shutter with a stone.<br><br> Lord Asriel was standing close by. The moon was shining full on this side of the building, so they would both be clearly visible from some way off.<br><br> Malcolm whispered, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to wake any of the other nuns, and I don&#x2019;t want to startle Sister Fenella because of her heart. We got to be careful.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m in your hands,&#x201d; said Lord Asriel.<br><br> Malcolm tapped again a little harder.<br><br> &#x201c;Sister Fenella,&#x201d; he whispered.<br><br> No response. He tapped a third time.<br><br> &#x201c;Sister Fenella, it&#x2019;s me, Malcolm,&#x201d; he whispered.<br><br> What he was really worried about was Sister Benedicta, of course. He dreaded to think what would happen if he woke her, so he kept as quiet as he could while still trying to wake Sister Fenella, which was not easy.<br><br> Asriel stood still, watching and saying nothing.<br><br> Finally Malcolm heard a stirring inside the room. Lyra gave a little mew, and then it sounded as if Sister Fenella moved a chair or a small table. Her soft old voice murmured something, like a word or two of comfort to the baby.<br> He tried again, just a little louder. &#x201c;Sister Fenella . . .&#x201d;<br><br> A little exclamation of shock.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s me, Malcolm,&#x201d; he said.<br><br> A soft noise, like the movement of bare feet on the floor, and then the clock of the window catch.<br> &#x201c;Sister Fenella&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Malcolm? What are you doing?&#x201d;<br><br> Like him, she was whispering. Her voice was frightened and thick with sleep. She hadn&#x2019;t opened the shutter.<br><br> &#x201c;Sister, I&#x2019;m sorry, I really am,&#x201d; he said quickly. &#x201c;But Lyra&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s here, and he&#x2019;s being pursued by&#x2014;by his enemies, and he really needs to see Lyra before&#x2014;before he goes on somewhere else. To&#x2014;to say goodbye,&#x201d; he added.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s nonsense, Malcolm! You know we can&#x2019;t let him&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Sister, please! He&#x2019;s really in earnest,&#x201d; Malcolm said, finding that phrase from somewhere.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s impossible. You must go away now, Malcolm. This is a bad thing to ask. Go away before she wakes up. I daren&#x2019;t think what Sister Benedicta&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> Malcolm didn&#x2019;t dare think it either. But then he felt Lord Asriel&#x2019;s hand on his shoulder, and the man said, &#x201c;Let me speak to Sister Fenella. You go and keep watch, Malcolm.&#x201d;<br><br> Malcolm moved away to the corner of the building. From there he could see the bridge and most of the garden, and watched as Lord Asriel leaned towards the shutter and spoke quietly. It was a whisper; Malcolm could hear nothing at all. How long Asriel and Sister Fenella spoke he couldn&#x2019;t have guessed, but it was a long time, and he was shivering hard when he saw, to his amazement, the heavy shutter move slowly. Lord Asriel stood back to let it open, and then stepped in again, showing his open, weapon-less hands, turning his head a little to let the moonlight fall clearly on his face.<br><br> He whispered again. Then there was a minute&#x2014;two minutes, perhaps&#x2014;in which nothing happened; and then Sister Fenella&#x2019;s thin arms held out the little bundle, and Asriel took it with infinite delicacy. His leopard dï¿½mon stood up to put her forepaws on his waist, and Asriel held the baby down so she could whisper to Lyra&#x2019;s dï¿½mon.<br><br> How had he persuaded Sister Fenella? Malcolm could only wonder. He watched the man lift the baby again and walk along the grass between one bare flower bed and the next, holding the bundle high so he could whisper to her, rocking her gently, strolling along slowly in the brilliant moonlight. At one point he seemed to be showing the moon to Lyra, pointing up at it and holding her so she could see, or perhaps he was showing Lyra to the moon; at any rate he looked like a lord in his own domain, with nothing to fear and all the silvery night to enjoy.<br><br> Up and down he strolled with his child. Malcolm thought of Sister Fenella waiting in fear&#x2014;in case Lord Asriel didn&#x2019;t bring her back, in case his enemies attacked, in case Sister Benedicta suspected something was up. But there was no sound from the priory, no sound from the road, no sound from the man and his baby daughter in the moonlight.<br><br> At one point the leopard dï¿½mon seemed to hear something. Her tail lashed once, her ears pricked, her head turned to face the bridge. Malcolm and Asta turned immediately, ears and eyes tightly focused on the bridge, every separate stone of which was clearly outlined in black and silver; but nothing moved, and there was no sound but the call of a hunting owl half a mile away.<br><br> Presently the leopard dï¿½mon&#x2019;s statue-like stillness melted, and she moved away once more, lithe and silent. Malcolm realized that that was true of the man as well&#x2014;during their journey over the river and through the meadow, into the orchard and up to the priory wall, he had not heard the slightest sound of footsteps. Asriel might as well have been a ghost, for all the sound he made.<br><br> He was turning now at the end of the walk and making for Sister Fenella&#x2019;s window again. Malcolm watched the bridge, the garden, what he could see of the road, and saw nothing wrong; and when he turned, Asriel was handing the little bundle up through the window, whispering a word or two, and silently swinging the shutter closed.<br><br> Then he beckoned, and Malcolm joined him. It was very difficult to make no noise at all, even on grass, and Malcolm watched to see how the man set his feet down: there was something leopardlike about it&#x2014;something to practice himself, anyway.<br><br> Back through the orchard, back to the hedge, through the brambles, into the meadow, across to the willow stump&#x2014;<br><br> Then a stronger, yellower light than the moon stabbed the sky. Someone on the bridge had a searchlight, and Malcolm heard the sound of a gas engine.<br><br> &#x201c;There they are,&#x201d; said Asriel quietly. &#x201c;Leave me here, Malcolm.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No! I got a better idea. Take my canoe and go down the river. Just get me back across to the other side first.&#x201d;<br><br> The idea occurred to Malcolm in the same moment he said it.<br><br> &#x201c;You sure?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You can go downstream a long way. They&#x2019;ll never think of that. Come on!&#x201d;<br><br> He stepped in and untied the painter, holding the boat tight to the bank while Asriel got in too; then Malcolm paddled swiftly and as quietly as he could across to the inn garden, though the current wanted to whirl him out into the open water, where they&#x2019;d be visible from the bridge.<br><br> Asriel caught hold of the fixed line on the little jetty while Malcolm got out; then he let Malcolm hold the boat while he got in the right way round, took the paddle, and held out his hand to shake.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get her back to you,&#x201d; he said, and then he was gone, speeding with long, powerful strokes down the river on the swollen current, the leopard daemon like a great figurehead at the prow. <i>La Belle Sauvage</i> had never gone so fast, Malcolm thought.</p><h2>Star Wars: The Prequel Trilogy (Episodes I, II &amp; III)</h2><p>For the first time in one stunning volume, here is the complete, epic story arc: The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, and Revenge of the Sith.

The resultant glare rose off the flat, sandy surface in a wet shimmer of blistering heat to fill the gaps between the massive cliff faces and solitary outcroppings of the mountains that were the planet&#x2019;s sole distinguishing feature. Sharply etched, the monoliths stood like sentinels keeping watch in a watery haze.<br><br>When the Podracers streaked past, engines roaring with ferocious hunger and relentless drive, the heat and the light seemed to shatter and the mountains themselves to tremble.<br><br>Anakin Skywalker leaned into the curve of the raceway that took him past the stone arch marking the entry into Beggar&#x2019;s Canyon on the first lap of the run, easing the thruster bars forward, giving the engines a little more juice. The wedge-shaped rockets exploded with power, the right a tad harder than the left, banking the Pod in which Anakin sat sharply left to clear the turn. Swiftly, he adjusted the steering to straighten the racer, boosted power further, and shot through the arch. Loose sand whiplashed in the wake of his passing, filling the air with a gritty sheen, whirling and dancing through the heat. He ripped into the canyon, fingers playing across the controls, hands steady on the steering.<br><br>It was all so quick, so instantaneous. One mistake, one misjudgment, and he would be out of the race and lucky if he weren&#x2019;t dead. That was the thrill of it. All that power, all that speed, just at his fingertips, and no margin for error. Two huge turbines dragged a fragile Pod over sandy flats, around jagged-edged mountains, down shadowed draws, and over heart-wrenching drops in a series of twisting, winding curves and jumps at the greatest speed a driver could manage. Control cables ran from the Pod to the engines, and energy binders locked the engines to each other. If any part of the three struck something solid, the whole of the assembly would collapse in a splintering of metal and a fiery wash of rocket fuel. If any part broke free, it was all over.<br><br>A grin split Anakin&#x2019;s young face as he injected a bit more power into the thrusters.<br><br>Ahead, the canyon narrowed and the shadows deepened. Anakin bore down on the slit of brightness that opened back onto the flats, keeping low to the ground where passage was widest. If he stayed high, he risked brushing the cliff faces on either side. That had happened to Regga in a race last month, and they were still looking for the pieces.<br><br>It would not happen to him.<br><br>He shoved the thruster bars forward and exploded through the gap onto the flats, engines screaming.<br><br>Sitting in the Pod with his hands on the controls, Anakin could feel the vibration of the engines travel up the control cables and fill him with their music. Wrapped in his rough-made jumpsuit, his racing helmet, his goggles, and his gloves, he was wedged so closely in his seat that he could feel the rush of the wind across the Pod&#x2019;s skin beneath him. When he raced like this, he was never simply the driver of a Podracer, never just an additional part. Rather, he was at one with the whole, and engines, Pod, and he were bound together in a way he could not entirely explain. Each shimmy, each small throb, each tug and twist of strut and tie were apparent to him, and he could sense at any given moment exactly what was happening throughout the length and breadth of his racer. It spoke to him in its own language, a mix of sounds and feelings, and though it did not use words, he could understand everything it said.<br><br>Sometimes, he thought dreamily, he could sense what it would say before it even spoke.<br><br>A flash of gleaming orange metal shot past him on his right, and he watched the distinctive split-X of Sebulba&#x2019;s engines flare out before him, taking away the lead he had seized through an unusually quick start. His brow wrinkled in disgust at himself for his momentary lapse of concentration and his dislike of the other racer. All gangly and crook-legged, Sebulba was as twisted inside as out, a dangerous adversary who won often and took delight in doing so at the expense of others. The Dug had caused more than a dozen crashes of other Podracers in the past year alone, and his eyes glinted with wicked pleasure when he recounted the tales to others on the dusty streets of Mos Espa. Anakin knew Sebulba well&#x2014;and knew better than to take chances with him.<br><br>He rode the thruster bars forward, fed fresh power to the engines, and rocketed ahead.<br><br>It didn&#x2019;t help, he supposed as he watched the distance between them narrow, that he was human or, much worse, that he was the only human ever to drive in the Podraces. The ultimate test of skill and daring on Tatooine and the favorite spectator sport of the citizens of Mos Espa, it was supposed to be beyond the skill and capability of any human. Multiple arms and multihinged joints, stalk eyes, heads that swiveled 180 degrees, and bodies that twisted as if boneless gave advantages to other creatures that humans could not begin to overcome. The most famous racers, the best of a rare breed, were strangely shaped, complexly formed beings with a penchant for taking risks that bordered on insanity.<br><br>But Anakin Skywalker, while nothing like these, was so intuitive in his understanding of the skills required by his sport and so comfortable with its demands that his lack of these other attributes seemed to matter not at all. It was a source of some mystery to everyone, and a source of disgust and growing irritation to Sebulba in particular.<br><br>Last month, in another race, the wily Dug had tried to run Anakin into a cliff face. He had failed only because Anakin sensed him coming up from behind and underneath, an illegal razor saw extended to sever Anakin&#x2019;s right Steelton control cable, and Anakin lifted away to safety before the saw could do its damage. His escape cost him the race, but allowed him to keep his life. It was a trade he was still angry at having been forced to make.<br><br>The racers whipped through columns of ancient statuary and across the floor of the arena erected on the edge of Mos Espa. They swept under the winner&#x2019;s arch, past row upon row of seats crammed with spectators cheering them on, past pit droids, repair stations, and the boxes where the Hutts watched in isolated splendor above the commoners. From an overlook in a tower centered on the arch, the two-headed Troig who served as announcer would be shouting out their names and positions to the crowd. Anakin allowed himself a momentary glimpse of blurred figures that were left behind so fast they might have been nothing more than a mirage. His mother, Shmi, would be among them, worrying as she always did. She hated watching him drive in the Podraces, but she couldn&#x2019;t help herself. She never said so, but he thought she believed that simply by being there she could keep him from coming to harm. It had worked so far. He had crashed twice and failed to finish even once, but after more than half a dozen races he was unharmed. And he liked having her there. It gave him a strange sort of confidence in himself he didn&#x2019;t like to think about too closely.<br><br>Besides, what choice did they have in the matter? He raced because he was good at it, Watto knew he was good at it, and whatever Watto wanted of him he would do. That was the price you paid when you were a slave, and Anakin Skywalker had been a slave all his life.<br><br>Arch Canyon rose broad and deep before him, an expanse of rock leading into Jag Crag Gorge, a twisting channel the racers were required to navigate on their way to the high flats beyond. Sebulba was just ahead, rocketing low and tight across the ground, trying to put some distance between Anakin and himself. Behind Anakin, close now, were three other racers spread out against the horizon. A quick glance revealed Mawhonic, Gasgano, and Rimkar trailing in his strange bubble pod. All three were gaining. Anakin started to engage his thrusters, then drew back. They were too close to the gorge. Too much power there, and he would be in trouble. Response time in the channel was compacted down to almost nothing. It was better to wait.<br><br>Mawhonic and Gasgano seemed to agree, settling their Pods into place behind his as they approached the split in the rock. But Rimkar was not content to wait and roared past Anakin split seconds before they entered the cleft and disappeared into darkness.<br><br>Anakin leveled out his Pod, lifting slightly from the rock-strewn floor of the channel, letting his memory and his instincts take him down the winding cut. When he raced, everything around him slowed down rather than sped up. It was different than you&#x2019;d expect. Rock and sand and shadows flew past in a wild mix of patterns and shapes, and still he could see so clearly. All the details seemed to jump out at him, as if illuminated by exactly what should make them so difficult to distinguish. He could almost close his eyes and drive, he thought. He was that much in tune with everything around him, that much aware of where he was.<br><br>He eased swiftly down the channel, catching glimpses of Rimkar&#x2019;s engine exhausts as they flashed crimson in the shadows. Far, far overhead, the sky was a brilliant blue streak down the center of the mountain, sending a frail streamer of light into the gap that lost brilliance with every meter it dropped so that by the time it reached Anakin and his fellow racers, it barely cut the dark. Yet Anakin was at peace, lost deep within himself as he drove his Pod, bonded with his engines, given over to the throb and hum of his racer and the soft, velvet dark that folded about.<br><br>When they emerged into the light once more, Anakin jammed the thruster bars forward and streaked after Sebulba. Mawhonic and Gasgano were right behind. Ahead, Rimkar had caught Sebulba and was trying to edge past. The lanky Dug lifted his split-X engines slightly to scrape against Rimkar&#x2019;s Pod. But Rimkar&#x2019;s rounded shell eased smoothly away, unaffected. Side by side the racers tore across the high flats, headed for Metta Drop. Anakin closed on them, drawing away from Mawhonic and Gasgano. People said what they wanted about Watto&#x2014;and there was plenty to say that wasn&#x2019;t good&#x2014;but he had an eye for Podracers. The big engines jumped obediently as Anakin fed fuel into the thrusters, and in seconds he was drawing alongside Sebulba&#x2019;s split-X.<br><br>They were even when they reached Metta Drop and rocketed over and tumbled straight down.<br><br>The trick with drops, as every racer knew, was to gather enough speed going down to gain time over your opponents, but not so much speed that the racer couldn&#x2019;t pull out of the drop and level out again before it nose-dived into the rocks below. So when Sebulba pulled out early, Anakin was momentarily surprised. Then he felt the backwash of the split-X engines hammer into his Pod. The treacherous Dug had only looked as if he would pull out and instead had lifted away and then deliberately fishtailed atop both Anakin and Rimkar, using his exhaust to slam them against the cliff face.<br><br>Rimkar, caught completely by surprise, jammed his thruster bars forward in an automatic response that took him right into the mountain. Metal fragments of Pod and engines careened away from the rock wall in a fiery shower, leaving a long black scar along the ravaged surface.<br><br>Anakin might have gone the same way but for his instincts. Almost before he knew what he was doing, at the same instant he felt the backwash of Sebulba&#x2019;s engines slam into him, he lifted out of his own descent and away from the mountain, almost colliding with a surprised Sebulba, who veered off wildly to save himself. Anakin&#x2019;s sudden wrenching of his Pod&#x2019;s steering took him spinning away into the midday, off course and out of control. He pulled back on the steering, eased off on the thrusters, cut the fuel supply to the big engines, and watched the ground rise up to meet him in a rush of sand and reflected light.</p><h2>100 Days of Sunlight</h2><p><p><strong>When 16-year-old poetry blogger Tessa Dickinson is involved in a car accident and loses her eyesight for 100 days, she feels like her whole world has been turned upside-down.</strong></p><p>Terrified that her vision might never return, Tessa feels like she has nothing left to be happy about.

The coordinated focus of these materials is unique: biblical content, provocative questions, systematic theology, practical application, and the gospel story of God&#x2019;s grace presented all the way through Scripture.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Philip Graham Ryken,</strong> President, Wheaton College</p><p>&#x201c;These <em>Knowing the Bible</em> volumes introduce a significant and very welcome variation on the general run of inductive Bible studies. Such series often provide questions with little guidance, leaving students to their own devices. They thus tend to overlook the role of teaching in the church. By contrast, Knowing the Bible avoids the problem by providing substantial instruction with the questions. Knowing the Bible then goes even further by showing how any given passage connects with the gospel, the whole Bible, and Christian theology. I heartily endorse this orientation of individual books to the whole Bible and the gospel, and I applaud the demonstration that sound theology was not something invented later by Christians, but is right there in the pages of Scripture.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Graeme Goldsworthy,</strong>&nbsp;Former Lecturer in Old Testament, Biblical Theology, and Hermeneutics, Moore Theological College</p><p>&#x201c;What a gift to earnest, Bible-loving, Bible-searching believers! The organization and structure of the Bible study format presented through the <em>Knowing the Bible</em> series is so well conceived. Students of the Word are led to understand the content of passages through perceptive, guided questions, and they are given rich insights and application all along the way in the brief but illuminating sections that conclude each study. What potential growth in depth and breadth of understanding these studies offer. One can only pray that vast numbers of believers will discover more of God and the beauty of his Word through these rich studies.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Bruce A. Ware,</strong>&nbsp;T.

F*ck him in this case is not physical, it&#x2019;s mental. </p> <p>So many women get in trouble in their love lives, and 99.9 percent of that trouble could have been avoided if they&#x2019;d said, &#x201c;Well, f*ck him!&#x201d; a bit more often. Too many women are way too nice and compliant to their men, especially when these men don&#x2019;t deserve that kind of treatment. </p> <p>And yet, every woman I&#x2019;ve ever met tries to not be needy or wear her heart on her sleeve. She simply wants to protect her feelings. Nevertheless, most women I&#x2019;ve coached have had men seem very interested only to disappear suddenly. These women are left standing in the dark. Once the guy vanishes, they often find out it&#x2019;s easier to get the President of the United States on the phone than the man who seemingly really liked them...just not enough to stick around. </p> <p>This should stop. </p> <p>I, as a dating coach and author of books for women who want to get men, cannot take it anymore. You deserve better. This is not your fault. It&#x2019;s his! He needs to learn to be much more transparent and upfront. That said, we both know most men won&#x2019;t change. We can lead a horse to water, but we can&#x2019;t make it drink. Or can we? What if there was a way to change a guy&#x2019;s behavior? What if you could get into his head and take over the driver&#x2019;s wheel? What if you could make him do more of the things that you appreciate and need and less of the bad behaviors you dislike? At first, this might seem impossible. Nevertheless, I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ve already met women who are good at manipulating their men. </p> <p>Enter the high-value woman. You know her. You&#x2019;ve seen her. She&#x2019;s the woman who always has great men drooling over her. It&#x2019;s the woman you see getting all the attention. You often wonder, &#x201c;How does she do it? What do they see in her? What does she know that I don&#x2019;t?&#x201d; </p> <p>You might have even complained to your girlfriends that men just don&#x2019;t seem to notice what a catch you are. Your girlfriends may have even said, &#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t know what he&#x2019;s missing.&#x201d; What if you could make him see it? </p> <p>When you look at these high-value women who get their way with men, it might have surprised you that their looks don&#x2019;t seem to matter. The high-value woman can be great looking, average looking, or even bad looking. It doesn&#x2019;t matter. She knows her way around men. She knows how to mentally f*ck them. </p> <p>Are you ready to implement her strategies? </p> <p>You&#x2019;ll see behavior you&#x2019;ve never seen from him. He&#x2019;ll start to put in an effort that makes you feel like you&#x2019;re a queen because to him, you are. At first, it will be strange. If you&#x2019;ve never truly been in control of a man, it might feel like riding a horse for the first time. But soon, it will make you feel all tingly inside. </p> <p>I&#x2019;m not kidding. </p> <p>There&#x2019;s nothing more powerful than being in a relationship with a guy and having him do exactly what you want while he thinks it was his idea. (This is important, as you&#x2019;ll see. He needs to think he is the one in the driver&#x2019;s seat, even though you actually are.) </p> <p>This book is not about becoming someone you&#x2019;re not or turning your boyfriend into a spineless manslave. It&#x2019;s about your empowerment, about taking back what&#x2019;s yours. No man should ever be able to play games with you, to take you for granted, to treat you even a tiny bit less than you deserve.

Sam and Dave are on a mission. A mission to find something spectacular. So they dig a hole. And they keep digging. And they find ...nothing. Yet the day turns out to be pretty spectacular after all. Attentive readers will be rewarded with a rare treasure in this witty story of looking for the extraordinary - and finding it in a manner they'd never expect.<br></p><p>Mac Barnett is the author of several award-winning books for children, including President Taft Is Stuck in the Bath, illustrated by Chris Van Dusen, and Extra Yarn, illustrated by Jon Klassen, which won a Boston Globe-Horn Book Award and a Caldecott Honor. Mac Barnett lives in the USA, in California. Find Mac online at www.macbarnett.com and on twitter as @macbarnett.

Sam and Dave, who are either identical twin boys or friends who look astonishingly alike and share a sartorial sensibility, set out to dig a hole in the hopes of finding "something spectacular." With shovels in hand, the boys (with an eager terrier looking on) begin to tunnel into the soil, but they just can't seem to find anything of interest. What works spectacularly is the clever play between words and pictures. As in Klassen's This Is Not My Hat (Candlewick, 2012), readers are in on a joke to which the characters are oblivious. Namely, that each time the boys change direction, they narrowly miss discovering increasingly enormous jewels hidden in the earth. The book progresses with each verso showing the boys' progress, while the recto features simple text, mostly dialogue between the practical but unlucky explorers. About halfway through, a spread reveals a diamond so large it can barely be contained on the page; it dwarfs the two boys and their trusty canine companion&#x2014;but all for naught, since they decide to dig in a different direction. Exhausted and covered from head to toe in dirt, Sam and Dave decide to take a rest. Klassen's use of muted earth tones and uncomplicated compositions is paired well with Barnett's deadpan humor. As they nap in their hole, the dog continues to dig...until suddenly the trio is falling; they soon land in a place that looks an awful lot like home. Small details reveal that this house and its inhabitants are ever so slightly changed. Are they dreaming? On the other side of the world? In a different dimension? Readers will have to puzzle that one out for themselves.&#x2014;Kiera Parrott, School Library Journal</p><h2>The Prayer of Jabez: Bible Study</h2><p>The Prayer of Jabez Bible Study reveals how to make praying the Jabez prayer a lifetime habit.

Tomï¿½s started his life as a migrant worker and, when he died, was a university chancellor. (The UC Riverside library now bears his name.) <p> This tribute to Tomï¿½s and his mentor reminds us of the power of stories and those dedicated librarians who have changed the lives of so many people.

Throughout the hot days thereafter, she offers Tomas cool drinks of water and adventurous escapes into books; on slow days he teaches her Spanish until it&#39;s time to return home to Texas: &#39;I have a sad word to teach you today. The word is adios. It means good-bye.&#39; . . .

After completing his Greek education, he attended the American University in Cairo, Egypt, The National Bible Institute, and New York University. He earned his Doctor of Theology degree from Luther Rice Seminary. In addition, Dr. Zodhiates was the recipient of several honorary doctorates.<br> While serving in the British Army in Cairo, Egypt, Zodhiates received The Voice of the Gospel, a magazine published by The American Committee for the Evangelization of the Greeks. To pass the time, he decided to write an article for the magazine. He wrote it in English and, not thinking about it, wrote the accompanying letter in Greek. When they realized they had found someone who loved the Lord and knew both languages, they invited him to come to America in 1946.<br> In 1966, they elected Zodhiates as president of what is now called AMG International (Advancing the Ministries of the Gospel). Under his leadership, AMG grew from a small ministry focusing on the land of Greece to a worldwide evangelistic and relief ministry. AMG International provides a wide range of social services, including care for orphans and leprosy patients, and has an expanding evangelistic thrust of advertising the message of the gospel through paid newspaper and magazine gospel messages in many lands and languages. His mission was the regeneration of souls, but he did not ignore the physical needs of the people he met.<br> The author of over 200 books and booklets in English, as well as 82 in Greek, Zodhiates started a book house, AMG Publishers, which has since grown into a significant producer of Bibles and Christian books.<br> On October 10, 2009, Dr. Spiros Zodhiates was called home by his Heavenly Father. Throughout his six decades of leadership, Dr. Zodhiates demonstrated a profound commitment to the Word of God and a singular focus on accomplishing his calling faithfully. His style was marked by frugal stewardship, great enthusiasm, entrepreneurial courage and unexpected generosity.<br><p>"The Hebrew-Greek Key Word Study Bible is my favorite.

Where Emily lived, in the heart of New York City, the storm was at its worst. Sitting alone in the apartment she shared with her policeman father, she never imagined that a simple thunderstorm could be this bad.<br> <br>She clutched her cell phone and felt guilty for lying to her father. He&#x2019;d just called to check on her.<br> <br>&#x201c;All the police have been summoned into work, honey,&#x201d; he explained. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re doing double and triple shifts. The city&#x2019;s a madhouse because of the weather, and they need everyone on duty. Do me a favor, will you? Keep away from the windows. There are lightning strikes all over the city, and our top-floor apartment is at particular risk.&#x201d;<br> <br>Yet, despite his warning and her promise to keep away, Emily sat in the large window seat and watched the raging storm. This had always been her mother&#x2019;s favorite spot. She used to call it her &#x201c;perch&#x201d;: her special place to sit and watch the world moving around twenty stories below. Since her mother&#x2019;s death, Emily found herself sitting there more and more often, as though it could somehow bring her closer to her mother.<br> <br>But not only that; from this vantage point Emily could see the top of the Empire State Building. Her father had once told her that the building itself worked as a giant lightning rod to protect the other buildings around it. But as more and more forked lightning struck its tall antenna, she wondered how much more it could take.<br> <br>Emily hugged her knees to her chest to keep from trembling. She&#x2019;d never been frightened of thunder when her mother was alive. Somehow they&#x2019;d always found ways of making foul weather fun and exciting. But now, all alone with her father at work, Emily felt her mother&#x2019;s loss as acutely as the day she died.<br> <br>&#x201c;I wish you were here, Mom,&#x201d; she whispered sadly as she gazed out the window. Emily&#x2019;s eyes filled with tears that trickled down her cheeks.<br> <br>Suddenly there was an ever-louder peal of thunder and brilliant flash of lightning. It struck the Empire State so hard, the antenna at the top of the building exploded in a flash of electrical sparks and flying debris.<br> <br>Emily could hardly believe what she had just witnessed. She wiped the tears from her blurred eyes as all the lights in the tall building blinked out. Immediately after, the lights in buildings around it went out. The darkness spread like a grape-juice stain on the carpet, as the city was hit with a blackout.<br> <br>Emily followed the progression of the blackout as she peered up Broadway. Block after block was going dark. Even the street- and traffic lights were out. It wasn&#x2019;t long before the power outage reached her block, plunging her apartment building into darkness. She leaned farther against the glass and tried to see where the blackout ended. It didn&#x2019;t. The whole city was in darkness.<br> <br>She jumped as her cell burst to life. With trembling hands, she flipped it open and read her father&#x2019;s name on the small view screen.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dad,&#x201d; she cried. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t believe what just happened! The top of the Empire State just blew up! Lightning hit it and it exploded. Pieces went flying everywhere!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I just heard,&#x201d; her father said anxiously. &#x201c;Are you all right? Did anything hit our building?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, everything&#x2019;s fine,&#x201d; Emily replied, trying to hide the fact that she was far from fine. She was actually starting to get very frightened. &#x201c;But the power&#x2019;s gone out. From what I can see, it&#x2019;s dark all over the city.&#x201d;<br> <br>Emily heard another voice in the background. Her father cursed before speaking to her again.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re getting reports that the blackout has spread to all the boroughs and is hitting New Jersey. This is a big one, Em. And from what I&#x2019;ve just been told, it&#x2019;s not going to be fixed anytime soon. I need you to go into the bathroom and fill the tub with water. Then fill whatever you can in the kitchen. We don&#x2019;t know how long this is going to last, and we&#x2019;ll need that water.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I will,&#x201d; she promised. Then, before she could stop herself, Emily asked weakly, &#x201c;Dad, when are you coming home?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, honey,&#x201d; he answered. &#x201c;Hopefully soon. Look, do you want me to call Aunt Maureen and ask her to come over and stay with you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Emily loved her aunt, but she didn&#x2019;t want to sound like a baby. She was old enough to take care of herself. &#x201c;No thanks, Dad, I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re sure?&#x201d; her father asked. &#x201c;I bet she could use the company.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, I&#x2019;m sure,&#x201d; Emily said. &#x201c;The storm&#x2019;s just got me a bit freaked. But I&#x2019;ve got lots to do here. Besides, it&#x2019;s too dangerous for Maureen to come over in all this and then have to climb twenty flights of stairs. Really, I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d;<br> <br>There was a hesitation in her father&#x2019;s voice before he said, &#x201c;All right. But if you need me or anything at all, I&#x2019;m just a phone call away. Understand?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I do. Thanks, Dad,&#x201d; Emily said. &#x201c;Now I&#x2019;d better go before the water shuts down.&#x201d;<br> <br>Emily ended the call and used the light from her cell-phone screen to guide her into the kitchen. She quickly found the emergency flashlight and crossed to the bathroom.<br> <br>This was the standard operating procedure for blackouts. Fill the bathtub and every other container with water. One of the downsides of living in a tall building during a blackout was the pumps sending water up to the apartments soon stopped. If they didn&#x2019;t store all the water they could, they would quickly find themselves in a lot of trouble.<br> <br>She began to fill the bathtub, and then the pots and pans in the kitchen. Just as she finished filling the last big soup pot, the pressure behind the water flow started to weaken. It wouldn&#x2019;t be long before it stopped completely.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s better than nothing,&#x201d; she sighed aloud as she shut off all the faucets.<br> <br>While she worked, Emily had managed to forget about the storm for a few minutes. But with the water off, the sound of the rumbling thunder and police and fire sirens from the city were the only sounds in the apartment.<br> <br>Just outside the bathroom window, Emily saw another burst of lightning and heard more thunder. The lightning was so bright it left her seeing flashes, even after she closed her eyes. There was no pause between the light and sound, which meant this latest strike was very close.<br> <br>As the thunder rumbled angrily, Emily moved away from the window. This time she would follow her father&#x2019;s advice and stay well clear of all the windows. The storm was directly overhead&#x2014;and getting worse by the minute.</p><h2>My Teacher Is an Alien (1) (My Teacher Books)</h2><p><b>Could your teacher be an alien?

In this honest Advent devotional, best-selling progressive Christian author John Pavlovitz reminds us that God came to meet us in the low places of our lives -- and that Jesus continues to come low this Advent season. When we plant our feet firmly in the dirt of everyday life, we see Jesus meeting us in the low places: when we live humbly, when we seek forgiveness, in our grief and suffering, when we act on behalf of someone else, when we pray. As we walk the road of Advent, Jesus reminds us the invitation is not to escape this world to an elevated Heaven somewhere else, but to bring Heaven down. &#34;God with us&#34; is Jesus, getting low. Each devotional includes a scripture and Advent reflection on Jesus meeting us on the ground.</p><p>John Pavlovitz is a writer, pastor, and activist from Wake Forest, North Carolina. In the past four years his blog Stuff That Needs To Be Said has reached a diverse worldwide audience. A 20-year veteran in the trenches of local church ministry, John is committed to equality, diversity, and justice -- both inside and outside faith communities. In 2017 he released his first book, A Bigger Table.

But for all his greatness, there's also a dark side to Jordan: a ruthless competitor, a gambler. There's never been a biography that balanced these personas-until now.</p><p><strong>Roland Lazenby</strong> is the author of the critically acclaimed bestseller <i>Jerry West: The Life and Legend of a Basketball Icon</i>, among numerous other books.

The journalist has covered Jordan's career for nearly thirty years and his knowledge of the game and of this miraculous player shows in what is one of the best sports biographies in years."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Parade</i></i></b><br><br>"What makes this portrayal especially worthwhile is the long trail Lazenby follows before the awesome career even begins."&#x2015;<b><i><em>New York Times Book Review's </em>"Editor's Choice"</i></b><br><br>"It's not every day that I'm blown away by a book about a sports figure. But MICHAEL JORDAN: THE LIFE, by Roland Lazenby, ranks up there with the very best: <i>The Boys of Summer</i> by Roger Kahn, <i>Friday Night Lights</i> by Buzz Bissinger, and <i>Joe DiMaggio</i> by Richard Ben Cramer. The depth of reporting, his frequent ascent into poetry, and his intelligent analysis of the life of this complicated, fascinating American icon deserve Pulitzer Prize consideration.

For the Christian, however, contentment is something we must apply, work at, and make our own in every circumstance, because anxiety and frustration are not neutral behaviors.<p></p><p>It is certainly easier to go with our natural impulses when times are very hard or even just "annoying," but contentment is an important part of our Christian life. Even the apostle Paul had to "learn" contentment. So we shouldn't wonder why we're still in spiritual kindergarten -- repeating the same lessons over and over again -- if we haven't given ourselves to study contentment.</p><p></p><p>Thankfully, every test God gives on contentment is open book (even the pop quizzes!). In Learning Contentment, Nancy Wilson looks to the Bible and Puritans like Jeremiah Burroughs, Samuel Rutherford, Thomas Watson, and Charles Spurgeon to help us develop the practical, spiritual strength and the perspective that comes from contentment's deep satisfaction with the will of God.</p><p></p><p>This encouraging little book follows after Nancy Wilson's <i>Virtuous: A Study for Ladies of Every Age.</i> <i>Learning Contentment</i> includes concise explanations, application questions and assignments that will involve and challenge everyone, and lots of biblical wisdom for individuals and groups.</p></p><p><b>Nancy Wilson</b> has been a pastor's wife and homemaker in Moscow, Idaho for more than thirty years.
